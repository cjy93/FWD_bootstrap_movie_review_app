0,Top Gun: Maverick,https://youtu.be/giXco2jaZ_4,https://www.youtube.com/embed/giXco2jaZ_4,"May 27, 2022",,"Over thirty years after graduating from TOPGUN,[b] United States Navy Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell is a test pilot. While he has won many honors, repeated insubordination has kept him from flag rank.[c] His friend and former TOPGUN rival, Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky, is now commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and has often protected Maverick from being grounded. Rear Admiral Chester ""Hammer"" Cain cancels Maverick's ""Darkstar"" scramjet program in favor of funding drones. Before he can officially do so, Maverick sets a new flight plan to push into high-hypersonic speed, accomplishing the program's goal. The prototype is destroyed, however, when he pushes beyond Mach 10. Hammer cannot punish Maverick, as Iceman again saves his career by ordering him to NAS North Island for his next assignment, but warns that the era of manned fighter aircraft will soon end.

The Navy has been tasked with destroying an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant, which sits in a deep depression at the end of a canyon. It is defended by SA-3 Goa surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and what appear to be fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57[d] fighters. Maverick devises a plan to attack with two pairs of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. Although he wants to fly the mission, Maverick's job is to train an elite group of TOPGUN graduates assembled by air boss Vice Admiral Beau ""Cyclone"" Simpson, who dislikes Maverick's unorthodox methods.

Maverick out-dogfights his skeptical students to demonstrate that very low-altitude precision flying, not high-altitude attacks, is necessary. Lieutenants Jake ""Hangman"" Seresin and Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw—son of Maverick's late best friend and RIO Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw—clash; Rooster dislikes Hangman's cavalier attitude, while Hangman criticizes Rooster's cautious flying. Maverick reunites with former girlfriend Penny Benjamin, to whom he reveals that Rooster's now-dead mother made him promise that Rooster would not become a pilot. Rooster, unaware of the promise, resents Maverick for impeding his military career and blames him for his father's death.

While teaching teamwork and convincing students that the mission is viable, Maverick fears Rooster may be right about Goose's death. He is reluctant to further interfere with Rooster's career but also does not want to send him on the very dangerous mission. Maverick relays his doubts to Iceman, who has throat cancer; before dying he reassures him that ""the Navy needs Maverick"". With his protector gone, Cyclone removes Maverick as instructor and relaxes the mission parameters, which are easier to accomplish but make escape much more difficult. During Cyclone's announcement, Maverick makes an unauthorized flight through the training course with his preferred parameters, proving that it can be done. Cyclone reluctantly appoints Maverick as team leader.

Maverick flies the lead F/A-18E in the strike package, buddy lasing for an F/A-18F flown by Lieutenant Natasha ""Phoenix"" Trace and WSO Lieutenant Robert ""Bob"" Floyd. Rooster will lead the second strike pair, which includes Lieutenant Reuben ""Payback"" Fitch and WSO Lieutenant Mickey ""Fanboy"" Garcia. After the four jets launch from USS Theodore Roosevelt, guided missile cruiser USS Leyte Gulf fires Tomahawk cruise missiles to destroy the nearby air base. The team successfully destroys the plant but engage SAMs during their escape. Rooster runs out of countermeasures, and Maverick sacrifices his jet to protect Rooster. Believing Maverick to be killed, the others are ordered back to the carrier. Rooster returns to find Maverick safely ejected and being targeted by an Mi-24 gunship. After destroying the gunship, he is shot down by a SAM and ejects. The two rendezvous and steal an F-14 Tomcat from the destroyed air base. Maverick and Rooster manage to destroy two Su-57s, but a third arrives as they run out of ammunition and countermeasures. Hangman, arriving from standby, shoots down the Su-57 and the planes return to the carrier.

Later, Maverick and Rooster work together on a P-51 Mustang. Rooster looks at a photo of their mission's success, pinned alongside a photo of his late father and a young Maverick, as Penny and Maverick fly off into the sunset in the Mustang."
1,Everything Everywhere All at Once,https://youtu.be/wxN1T1uxQ2g,https://www.youtube.com/embed/wxN1T1uxQ2g,"Mar 25, 2022",,"Part 1: Everything
Evelyn Quan Wang is a Chinese-American woman who runs a struggling laundromat with her husband, Waymond. Tensions are high due to the laundromat being audited by the IRS. Additionally, Waymond is trying to give Evelyn divorce papers; Evelyn's demanding father, Gong Gong,[a] has just arrived from Hong Kong; and Evelyn's daughter, Joy, has been trying to get her mother to accept her girlfriend, Becky.

While at the IRS building for a meeting with IRS inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre, Waymond's personality changes when his body is briefly taken over by Alpha Waymond, a version of Waymond from a universe he calls the ""Alphaverse"". Alpha Waymond explains to Evelyn that many parallel universes exist, since every choice made creates a new universe. The people of the Alphaverse, led by the late Alpha Evelyn, developed ""verse-jumping"" technology that allows people to access the skills, memories, and body of their parallel universe counterparts by fulfilling specific conditions. The multiverse is being threatened by Jobu Tupaki, formerly Alpha Joy. Her mind was splintered after Alpha Evelyn pushed her to extensively verse-jump; Jobu Tupaki now experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. With her godlike power she has created a black hole-like ""everything bagel""[b] that can potentially destroy the multiverse.

Evelyn is given verse-jumping technology to fight Jobu Tupaki's verse-jumping minions, who begin converging in the IRS building. Evelyn learns of Waymond's plans to divorce her and discovers other lives where she made different choices and flourished, such as by becoming a kung fu master and movie star instead of leaving China with Waymond, who becomes a successful businessman. Alpha Waymond comes to believe that Evelyn, as the greatest failure of all Evelyns of the multiverse, has the untapped potential to defeat Jobu Tupaki. Alpha Gong Gong instructs Evelyn to kill Joy to hinder Jobu Tupaki, but Evelyn refuses. She decides she must face Jobu Tupaki by gaining the same powers as her, so she verse-jumps repeatedly while battling Jobu Tupaki's minions and Alpha Gong Gong's soldiers. After the battle, Alpha Waymond is killed by Jobu Tupaki in the Alphaverse and Evelyn's mind overloads.

Part 2: Everywhere
Evelyn's mind splinters and she discovers other, bizarre universes, including one in which humans have hot dogs for fingers and she is in a romantic relationship with Deirdre, and another where she works alongside a teppanyaki chef who is secretly puppeteered by a raccoon. She learns that Jobu Tupaki created the everything bagel not to destroy everything, but to destroy herself, and has been searching for an Evelyn who can understand her. Jobu Tupaki feels that because there are so many vast universes and unending chaos, nothing truly matters.

In other universes, the Wangs are about to lose the laundromat due to tax errors, and businessman Waymond rejects movie star Evelyn after decades apart. Evelyn is nearly swayed to Jobu Tupaki's cause and stabs her universe's Waymond. She almost joins Jobu Tupaki in entering the bagel, but stops when she hears Waymond's calls to be kind and have hope. Evelyn defeats Alpha Gong Gong and Jobu Tupaki's fighters by using her multiverse knowledge to find what is hurting each of them and gives them happiness. Evelyn reaches Jobu Tupaki and tells her that she is not alone and that Evelyn will always choose to be with her, despite everywhere else she could be. Meanwhile, in a parallel universe, Evelyn confronts Gong Gong and reconciles with Waymond and Joy, and Waymond convinces Deirdre to let the Wangs redo their taxes. Jobu Tupaki initially rejects Evelyn, but returns to her, and they embrace.

Part 3: All at Once
Shortly thereafter, the family's relationships and lives have improved; Becky is now regarded as a part of the family, Waymond and Evelyn share a brief but romantic moment for the first time in a long while, and they return to the IRS building on a second chance to file their taxes. As Deirdre talks, Evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternate selves and the multiverse, before she grounds herself back in her home universe."
2,The Batman,https://youtu.be/mqqft2x_Aa4,https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqqft2x_Aa4,"Mar 4, 2022",,"On Halloween, Gotham City mayor Don Mitchell Jr. is murdered by a masked psychopath calling himself the Riddler. Reclusive billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante Batman, investigates the murder alongside the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). Lieutenant James Gordon discovers a message that the Riddler left for Batman. The following night, the Riddler kills commissioner Pete Savage and leaves another message for Batman.

Batman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a thumb drive in Mitchell's car containing images of Mitchell with a woman, Annika Kosolov, at the Iceberg Lounge—a nightclub operated by the Penguin, mobster Carmine Falcone's lieutenant. While the Penguin pleads ignorance, Batman notices that Selina Kyle, Annika's roommate and lover, works at the club as a waitress. When Annika disappears, Batman sends Selina back to the Iceberg Lounge for answers and discovers that Savage was on Falcone's payroll, as is district attorney Gil Colson.

The Riddler abducts Colson, straps a timed collar bomb to his neck, and sends him to interrupt Mitchell's funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler calls him via Colson's phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot answer three riddles. Colson refuses to answer the third—the name of the informant who gave the GCPD information that led to a historic drug bust ending mobster Salvatore Maroni's operation—and dies. Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni's operation transferred to Falcone, with many corrupt GCPD officers involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal money and discovers Annika's corpse in a car trunk. After a car chase, Batman captures the Penguin but learns he is not the informant.

Batman and Gordon follow the Riddler's trail to the ruins of an orphanage funded by Bruce's murdered parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, where they learn that the Riddler holds a grudge against the Wayne family. Bruce's butler and caretaker, Alfred Pennyworth, is hospitalized after opening a letter bomb addressed to Bruce. The Riddler leaks evidence that Thomas, who was running for mayor before he was murdered, hired Falcone to kill a journalist for threatening to reveal details about Martha and her family's history of mental illness. Bruce, who grew up believing his father was morally upstanding, confronts Alfred, who maintains that Thomas only asked Falcone to threaten the journalist into silence; Thomas planned to turn himself and Falcone over to the police once he found out Falcone murdered the journalist instead. Alfred believes that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to prevent this.

Selina reveals to Batman that Falcone is her neglectful father. She decides to kill him after learning that he strangled Annika because Mitchell told her that Falcone was the informant. Batman and Gordon arrive in time to stop her, but the Riddler kills Falcone as he is being arrested. The Riddler is unmasked as forensic accountant Edward Nashton and is incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital, where he tells Batman he took inspiration from him when targeting the corrupt. Batman learns that Nashton has stationed car bombs around Gotham and cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect Bella Reál.

The bombs destroy the seawall around Gotham and flood the city. Nashton's followers attempt to kill Reál but are stopped by Batman and Selina. In the aftermath, Nashton befriends another inmate,[a] while Selina deems Gotham beyond saving and leaves. Batman aids recovery efforts and vows to inspire hope in Gotham."
3,Hustle,https://youtu.be/nM4iy0reaCA,https://www.youtube.com/embed/nM4iy0reaCA,"Jun 8, 2022",,"Stanley Sugerman, a jaded international scout for the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA, lives life on the road searching for future stars. His frequent travel takes a toll on his wife Teresa and daughter Alex. While he is liked by 76ers owner Rex Merrick, he clashes with Rex's son Vincent. Rex promotes Stanley to assistant coach, allowing him to remain at home with his family. The same evening, however, Rex dies, leaving Vince in charge.

Three months later, Vince demotes Stanley again to scout, sending him overseas to find a new star. Meeting with his former college teammate Leon Rich, he encourages him to leave the 76ers and also become a player agent. When Stanley's plan to scout another player in Spain falls through, watching a local pick-up game, he is stunned by an incredibly talented unknown player.

Stanley attempts to speak with the man, Bo Cruz, but is rebuffed until he makes a Facetime call to Dirk Nowitzki to prove his legitimacy. Bo and his mother Paola recount his life story: he was a talented player from an early age and was invited to play in America at age 15, but stayed in Spain after his girlfriend became pregnant with his daughter Lucia. Bo now works construction and makes extra money hustling at basketball.

After an impressive workout with members of the Spanish national team, Stanley urges the 76ers front office to sign Cruz immediately, but Vincent is unconvinced. Taking matters into his own hands, he pays to bring Cruz to the US, telling him he will be signed by the Sixers or enter the NBA draft. At the airport, Bo is detained for an aggravated assault conviction he received in Spain. He is released, but warned that he could be deported if he were to be arrested in America.

Stanley takes Bo to play at a showcase organized by Leon, which is also attended by the presumptive second overall pick Kermit Wilts. Stanley advises Bo that if he shuts down Wilts, it will significantly raise his stock with the Sixers. During the workout, Cruz shows flashes of talent, but struggles on offense and at guarding Wilts, who trash talks him and throws him off his game.

When Vince passes on Bo, Stanley quits the 76ers to prepare Cruz for the NBA Draft Combine six weeks away. Telling Bo his only weakness is his sensitivity, he builds on his mental toughness. Teresa and Alex assist with the training by preparing meals and taping workouts. Bo improves dramatically through Stanley's coaching, but Leon can't get him into the Draft Combine after Vince spreads information about Bo's assault charge.

Furious at Stanley, Bo eventually reveals the charge stemmed from a fight with Lucia's mother's boyfriend after she tried to claim sole custody of Lucia. Stanley admits his injured hand was from a drunk driving accident while in college, derailing his basketball team's season and putting him in jail for six months. Their trust renewed, Stanley works tirelessly to get Bo into the combine, without success.

To create interest, the Sugermans enlist Julius Erving to create a viral video of ""the Boa Challenge"", where people, including 76ers player Tobias Harris, attempt to score on Bo for money. Cruz is eventually accepted into the combine, and Stanley flies Lucia and Paola to the US to support him. Bo impresses in the physical elements of the combine, but faces off with Wilts again in a five-on-five exhibition game. He initially performs well, but Kermit begins talking trash about Bo's daughter and mother, so he eventually breaks, pushing Wilts down, and storming out.

Both Stanley and Bo think their journey is over. At the airport for Bo's flight back to Spain, Leon calls about a private game for players and front office members that Bo and Kermit have both been invited to. Playing without pressure, Cruz locks down Wilts defensively and demonstrates his offensive abilities. Rex's daughter Kat, who recognizes Stanley's talent, reveals she is taking over from Vince and rehires him as an assistant coach.

Five months later, the 76ers and Boston Celtics tip off for a game against each other with Stanley now the assistant coach of the 76ers and Bo playing for the Boston Celtics."
4,The Northman,https://youtu.be/oMSdFM12hOw,https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMSdFM12hOw,"Apr 22, 2022",,"In AD 895, King Aurvandill returns to the island of Hrafnsey after his overseas conquests, reuniting with his wife, Queen Gudrún, and his heir, Prince Amleth. To prepare Amleth for his eventual ascension, the two participate in a spiritual ceremony overseen by Aurvandill's jester, Heimir. The next morning, Aurvandill's bastard brother Fjölnir murders the king, raids his hillfort and carries away Gudrún. Amleth flees by boat, swearing vengeance.

Years later, Amleth lives as a berserker with a band of Vikings. After an attack in Gardariki, Amleth encounters a Seeress in the temple of Svetovit; the Seeress predicts that Amleth will soon take revenge on Fjölnir, and that his path is intertwined with a Maiden-King. Amleth learns that Fjölnir was overthrown by Harald of Norway and lives in exile in Iceland. Posing as a slave, Amleth sneaks aboard a ship. He encounters a Slavic woman named Olga, who claims to be a sorceress. They are taken to Fjölnir's farm, where he learns his mother has married Fjölnir and bore him a son named Gunnar.

One night, Amleth encounters a magician who facilitates a spiritual dialogue between Amleth and the late Heimir, revealed to have been murdered by Fjölnir. He then tells Amleth about Draugr, a magical sword at the Gates of Hel. Amleth enters a mound and obtains the blade after fighting the undead Mound Dweller. He hides it upon return to the farm. The next day, Amleth is selected to compete in a game of knattleikr against another farm. The game turns violent and Gunnar is almost killed, but Amleth saves him. As a reward, Fjölnir's adult son, Thorir, grants him overseer duties and allows him to choose a woman.

During the evening celebrations, Amleth and Olga make love; they promise to overcome Fjölnir together. Amleth kills several of Fjölnir's men, and Olga mixes their food with fly agaric, a potent hallucinogen. The ensuing chaos and the suspicion that the Christian slaves are behind the killings allows Amleth to enter Fjölnir's house. He meets his mother, who reveals that she was originally taken into slavery and that Amleth's conception was the result of rape. She reveals that she wanted Aurvandill and Amleth dead; she tries but fails to seduce Amleth. Enraged, Amleth kills Thorir and steals his heart.

Gudrún reveals Amleth's true identity to Fjölnir, and calls for him to kill him. Fjölnir threatens to kill Olga, but Amleth offers to trade Olga's life for Thorir's heart. After a severe beating, Amleth is released from his restraints by a flock of ravens. Olga rescues Amleth and the two escape by boat. Amleth has a vision and discovers that Olga is pregnant with twins, one of whom will become the Maiden-King prophesied by the Seeress. Fearing that his children will never be safe, Amleth decides to kill his uncle and jumps overboard, despite Olga's pleas.

Back at the farm, Amleth frees the slaves and kills most of Fjölnir's men. While searching for Fjölnir, Amleth is attacked by his mother and drives Draugr through her heart. Gunnar attacks Amleth, stabbing him repeatedly in the back before Amleth kills him. Fjölnir, discovering his wife and son dead, tells Amleth to meet him at the Gates of Hel—the crater of the volcano Hekla—to resolve the conflict via holmgang. At the volcano, Amleth and Fjölnir engage in a fierce swordfight; Fjölnir is decapitated, and Amleth is fatally wounded. As Amleth lies dying, he has a future vision of Olga embracing their twin children, before a valkyrie appears to carry him through the gates of Valhöll (Valhalla)."
5,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,https://youtu.be/aWzlQ2N6qqg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWzlQ2N6qqg,"May 6, 2022",,"America Chavez and a version of Stephen Strange are chased by a demon in the space between universes while searching for the Book of Vishanti. That Strange is killed and Chavez accidentally creates a portal that transports herself and Strange's corpse to Earth-616,[N 1] where that universe's version of Strange rescues Chavez from another demon[N 2] with help from the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong. Chavez explains that the beings are hunting her because she has the power to travel through the multiverse.

Recognizing witchcraft runes, Strange consults Wanda Maximoff for help but realizes that she is responsible for the attacks. After acquiring the Darkhold and becoming the Scarlet Witch, Maximoff believes that controlling Chavez's powers will allow her to reunite with Billy and Tommy, the children she created during her time in Westview.[N 3] When Strange refuses to surrender Chavez, Maximoff attacks Kamar-Taj, killing many sorcerers. Chavez accidentally transports herself and Strange to Earth-838 while Maximoff uses the Darkhold to ""dreamwalk"", taking control of her Earth-838 counterpart, who lives a suburban life with her own Billy and Tommy. A surviving sorceress sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold and break the dreamwalk. Enraged, Maximoff forces Wong to lead her to Mount Wundagore, the source of the Darkhold's power, to reestablish the dreamwalk.

While searching for help, Strange and Chavez are apprehended by Earth-838's Sorcerer Supreme, Karl Mordo, and brought before the Illuminati, a group consisting of Mordo, Peggy Carter, Blackagar Boltagon, Maria Rambeau, Reed Richards, and Charles Xavier. They explain that through reckless use of their universe's Darkhold in an attempt to defeat Thanos, Earth-838's Strange triggered a universe-destroying ""incursion"". After defeating Thanos, the Illuminati executed their Strange to prevent him from causing more harm. Mordo believes that Earth-616's Strange is similarly dangerous, but Maximoff reestablishes her dreamwalk at Mount Wundagore and arrives in her Earth-838 counterpart's body before they can pass judgment. She kills all of the Illuminati except Mordo, whom Strange subdues before fleeing with Chavez. The two escape with help from the Earth-838 counterpart of Strange's ex-fiancé, Christine Palmer, a scientist working with the Illuminati.

Strange, Chavez, and Palmer enter the space between universes to find the Book of Vishanti, which is the antithesis to the Darkhold, but Maximoff appears and destroys it. She then takes over Chavez's mind, using her powers to send the others to an incursion-destroyed universe. Strange defeats the destroyed universe's Strange, who has been corrupted by his universe's Darkhold, and uses it to dreamwalk into the body of his deceased counterpart on Earth-616. With Wong's help, Strange saves Chavez from Maximoff as she tries to take Chavez's powers, and encourages Chavez to use her abilities. She transports Maximoff to Earth-838, where she sees Billy and Tommy recoil from her in fear while crying for their real mother. Realizing the error of her ways, Maximoff relents and uses her powers to bring down Mount Wundagore, simultaneously destroying all copies of the Darkhold throughout the multiverse and apparently sacrificing herself in the process. Chavez returns Strange and Palmer to their respective universes.

Sometime later, Kamar-Taj is repaired and the surviving sorcerers, joined by Chavez, continue training. Strange develops a third eye as a result of using the Darkhold and dreamwalking into a corpse. In a mid-credits scene, Strange is approached by a sorceress[N 4] who warns him that his actions have triggered an incursion that he must help fix. Strange follows her into the Dark Dimension."

It captures both the astronaut and mission control view of the triumphant moment, and the lesser-seen bottom up perspective of what it was like from an excited kid's perspective, living near NASA but mostly watching it on TV like hundreds of millions of others. It's ultimately both an exacting re-creation of this special moment in history and a kid's fantasy about being plucked from his average life in suburbia to secretly train for a covert mission to the moon."
7,The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,https://youtu.be/x2YHPZMj8r4,https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2YHPZMj8r4,"Apr 22, 2022",,"Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage is struggling with his career after being passed over for several major film roles and is constantly pestered and tormented by ""Nicky"", who appears to him as his younger (and more successful) self. His relationship with his ex-wife Olivia and daughter Addy is also marred by years of emotional neglect. Following an embarrassing and humiliating event at Addy's birthday party and losing a key film role, Cage plans to retire from acting. He decides to accept a vague offer of $1 million from his agent Richard Fink that involves going to Majorca to meet billionaire playboy Javi Gutierrez and to be the guest of honor at his birthday.

Upon meeting Javi, Cage is initially annoyed by his neediness and insistence that they create an improvisational movie based on a script he wrote, but is soon inspired by Javi's determination, and the two of them quickly bond over their surprisingly shared love of films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Paddington 2 (the latter of which Cage watches for the first time with Javi). Soon after, Cage is confronted by CIA agents Vivian and Martin. They suspect that Javi, who they claim made his fortune through arms dealing, is behind the kidnapping of Maria, the daughter of a Catalan anti-crime politician, with the hope that he will drop out of an upcoming election. Despite his insistence otherwise, Cage decides to help the CIA with the mission.

After successfully rigging the cameras in Javi's compound, Cage attends a party where he announces his collaboration with Javi on a new movie, as an excuse to stay on the compound long enough to find Maria. After a misadventure involving LSD, Cage discovers that Javi keeps a shrine room dedicated to all of his movies, including a wax figure of his character Castor Troy from the film Face/Off, complete with identical golden guns. Cage finds it difficult to betray Javi, but Vivian convinces him to work the kidnapping into their script so that he could potentially reveal where Maria is.

Cage explains his new idea to Javi, who believes that Cage is creatively bankrupt, and possibly has issues he needs to work out. Javi brings Olivia and Addy to his villa from Los Angeles; they are frightened and angered over what is happening. Cage tries to make amends with them, but they reject his appeal and accuse him of prioritizing his film career over his family. Javi privately goes to meet with his cousin Lucas, who is revealed to be the true arms dealer and the one who kidnapped Maria. Lucas warns him that Cage is working with the CIA and pressures him to kill Cage, or else Lucas will kill Javi. Cage begins to rethink his friendship.

Cage and Javi have a stand-off with each other, but neither can bring themselves to kill the other. Lucas sends his men after both of them, and they race back to the house to discover that Addy has been kidnapped. Cage takes Javi, Olivia and Javi's assistant Gabriela to the CIA safe house, only for the house to have been compromised; Martin has been killed, while Vivian sacrifices herself to kill Lucas's men before they can ambush the group. With Javi's help, Cage and Olivia pose as a reclusive criminal couple to get close to Lucas. They manage to locate Addy and Maria but are found out. However, Cage, Addy, Maria and Olivia escape while Javi and Gabriela stay behind to distract Lucas.

Cage, Addy, Olivia and Maria race to the American embassy with Lucas still in pursuit. Upon arrival, Lucas holds Cage at gunpoint, but Addy tosses him a knife which Cage uses to kill him—transitioning into the movie that Cage and Javi completed, presumably based on their adventure. Cage is applauded for his new film and congratulates Javi before going home with his family to watch Paddington 2, now with a better relationship."

They later relocate to Hollywood and, after casting as extras in commercials and shows, go on to star in the successful television series Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers in the early 1990s. However, when Dale gets his own show, Double-O-Dale, the two have a falling-out that leads to both shows' cancellation.

Thirty years later, Chip is a successful but disillusioned insurance salesman while Dale spends most of his time on the fan convention circuit. The two are contacted by their former Rescue Rangers co-star Monterey Jack, who owes money to the criminal Valley Gang due to his stinky cheese addiction. Monty warns the pair of a trafficking operation where toons are kidnapped, have their appearances altered, and are shipped overseas to produce bootlegs of their works for the rest of their lives. Later that night, the two are informed that Monty has been kidnapped. They meet Police Captain Putty and Officer Ellie Steckler; the latter reveals herself to be a big Rescue Rangers fan, and with the police's hands tied, she suggests Chip and Dale investigate on their own.

Chip and Dale visit Bjornson the Cheesemonger, Monty's cheese dealer, and ask about the Valley Gang. They are taken to the uncanny valley part of town and meet the gang's leader, Sweet Pete—an adult version of Peter Pan—and his henchmen Bob and Jimmy. Realizing they are investigating his bootlegging business, Pete tries to capture the pair, but the chipmunks escape. The two later share their discoveries with Ellie, learning that she is shunned by Putty due to acting on a bad tip and raiding the Nick Jr. studios with negative results. With Ellie's help, the chipmunks sneak into a bathhouse to steal Pete's fitness tracker. They trace his movements to a dock warehouse, though it is already abandoned by the time the police arrive. Inside, they find a large operating machine designed to alter toons' bodies, along with several toon parts, including Monty's mustache.

At the police station, the pair argue over the loss of Monty and their past feud but smell the scent of Monty's cologne. Realizing either Putty or Ellie is working with Sweet Pete, the two flee the station. At the ongoing Fan Con, they try to convince Ugly Sonic to ask his FBI contacts for help, but Pete and his henchmen arrive, having tracked Dale using his social media posts. In the ongoing chase, Bob is restrained and arrested, but Chip is caught by Jimmy and taken to the warehouse. Ellie is also lured there by Putty, revealing he is part of the Valley Gang and has been covering for Pete, including giving Ellie the false Nick Jr. tip.

Sweet Pete has Ellie call Dale to lure him to the warehouse, but Ellie sends a coded message using a Rescue Rangers episode. Dale realizes Ellie is in trouble and contacts former Rescue Rangers co-stars Gadget Hackwrench and Zipper, now married with children, for help. Dale enters the warehouse using a firework, which gets lodged into the machine and stops it before it can be used on Chip. The machine goes haywire, transforming Jimmy into a fairy and Pete into a giant amalgamation of various toons. While Ellie fights and defeats Putty, Pete chases Chip and Dale through the warehouse, revealing it to also be where the bootlegs are filmed. The chipmunks lure Pete to the docks and use a ploy from a Rescue Rangers episode to trap him.

The FBI, led by Ugly Sonic, arrive to arrest the Valley Gang. Sweet Pete fires a cannonball at Chip, but Dale takes the hit. Chip fears Dale is dead and apologizes for his behavior over the years, but Dale reveals he was protected by a golden pog Chip gave him. The chipmunks free all the bootlegged toons, including Monty, and Dale introduces the Rescue Rangers to Ellie, who decides to open her own detective agency. As the team departs, Dale convinces them to film a Rescue Rangers reboot, which is later released to great success."

She hides her personal interests from Ming such as the fact that she and her three best friends Miriam Mendelsohn, Priya Mangal, and Abby Park are fans of the boy band 4*Town. One night when Ming, who is strictly overprotective, discovers Mei's crush on Devon, the local convenience store clerk, she inadvertently humiliates Mei in public.

That night, Mei has a vivid nightmare involving red pandas. When she wakes up that morning, she has transformed into a large red panda. She hides from her parents and discovers that she transforms only when she is in a state of high emotion, though her hair remains red causing her to go to school in a beanie. Ming initially believes Mei is experiencing her first period, but learns the truth when she humiliates her at school, causing Mei to transform and run home in panic and tears.

Ming and Jin explain that Sun Yee was granted this transformation to protect her two daughters, and every female family member since then has also transformed when they came of age. This has become inconvenient and dangerous in modern times, so the red panda spirit must be sealed in a talisman by a ritual on the night of the Red Moon; the next being in a month's time. Mei's friends discover her transformation, but take a liking to it and Mei finds that concentrating on them helps control the red panda within her.

Ming allows Mei to resume her normal life, but refuses to let Mei attend 4*Town's upcoming concert. Instead, the girls secretly raise money for the tickets at school, exploiting the popularity of Mei's red panda form while lying to Ming. To cover the last ticket, Mei agrees to attend school bully Tyler Nguyen-Baker's birthday party as the red panda. At the party, Mei is upset to discover that the concert will be held on her ritual night instead of the following night like Abby said earlier on due to a misunderstanding. In the midst of her rage, she attacks Tyler when he insults her family, frightening the other kids. Ming discovers Mei's activities and accuses the latter's friends of corrupting and taking advantage of her. Afraid to stand up to her mother while ashamed of her actions, Mei fails to come to her friends' defense.

Mei's grandmother Wu, her aunts, and their neighbor Mr. Gao come to assist in her ritual to Ming's dismay. As Mei prepares herself, Jin finds videos she took of herself as the red panda with her friends and tells her she should not be ashamed of this side of her, but to embrace it. During the ritual as Mei's red panda form is about to be sealed, she decides to keep her powers and abandons the ritual to attend the concert at the SkyDome, where she reconciles with her friends. They discover that Tyler is also a 4*Town fan. However, an enraged Ming transforms into a kaiju-sized red panda (due to Mei inadvertently breaking her talisman during her escape from the temple) and disrupts the concert, intending to take Mei back by force.

Mei and Ming argue about the former's independence. As they quarrel, Mei accidentally knocks her mother unconscious. Wu and the aunts break their talismans to use their red panda forms to help drag Ming into a new ritual circle. Mei's friends and 4*Town join in singing to complete the ritual, sending Mei, Ming, and the other women to the astral plane. Mei reconciles with Ming and helps her mend her bond with Wu, whom Ming accidentally scarred in anger at some point before sealing her red panda form years prior and as a result couldn't move past her guilt. The other women conceal their red pandas in new talismans while Mei decides to keep hers with Ming accepting that she is finding her own path.

Later as the Lee family raises money to repair the damage caused at the SkyDome, Mei and Ming's relationship has improved as Mei balances her temple duties – where her red panda is now an attraction – with spending time with her friends, now including Tyler."
10,Armageddon Time,https://youtu.be/hpDGLrNP6J8,https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpDGLrNP6J8,"May 19, 2022",,"When I watch a movie by the writer-director James Gray, I often have the sensation that I’m seeing two films in one: the story being told and the one hovering offscreen — the one that’s all about his aspiration to be something larger than a mere storyteller. Early Gray films like “The Yards” (2000) and “We Own the Night” (2007) were modest tales suffused with his desire to be making “a ’70s movie.” “Ad Astra” (2019) was a lavishly scaled outer-space thriller suffused with his desire to be making “2001: A Space Odyssey.”

“Armageddon Time,” Gray’s eighth feature, marks a break from most of what he has done before. It’s a more personal project ­— an autobiographical coming-of-age memoir movie, set in Queens, New York, in 1980 and featuring an 11-year-old hero, Paul Graff (Banks Repeta), who navigates the sixth grade and the wider world that starts to feed into it. It’s a skillful, exacting, beguiling movie. But the other Gray movie — in this case, a high-handed progressive instructional one — looms as well.

“Armageddon Time,” which takes its title from a dub reggae cover by the Clash released in 1979 (and from the fact that Ronald Reagan, in a TV interview clip we see, drops a reference to “Armageddon” into his presidential campaign), has a strikingly different tone from Gray’s other work. Set largely among kids, and also in the home of Paul’s scruffy and combative Jewish family, the movie is bustling, personable, anecdotal — and also something that Gray hardly ever is, which is funny. The tone is sometimes reminiscent of the one struck by Barry Levinson in his memory films (“Diner,” “Tin Men,” “Avalon”), with Gray, in this case, trying to present his experience of growing up in as genuine a way as possible, as if he were ripping pages from his diary.

The opening scene, set on the first day of school, is a small marvel of observational staging. The teacher, the addled Mr. Turkeltaub (Andrew Polk), is trying to establish what a tough-love disciplinarian he is. The reason he feels he needs to do this is that right here, at the dawn of the 1980s, we can already feel the students’ attention wandering. Fifteen years of counterculture, channeled by popular culture, have worn down their respect.

Paul, who dreams of becoming an artist, draws a caricature of Mr. Turkeltaub, which gets passed around to great giggles, and after outing himself as the creator of the sketch Paul has to go up and stand next to the blackboard. So does Johnny (Jaylin Webb), a benign troublemaker who’s repeating the sixth grade, and is the sort of class clown who gets on teachers’ nerves because he knows how to play to the student peanut gallery. These two are pals; over the next few months, they become the class’s token (mild) delinquents. But Paul doesn’t have to endure what Johnny does when Johnny takes his perp walk to the front of the class — namely, Mr. Turkeltaub muttering “animal” at him. It’s a racist slur, and a reference to the fact that the school is in the process of being integrated.

What we once called “race relations” are at the center of “Armageddon Time.” Paul, who thinks he comes from a family that’s “superrich” (actually, they’re just dowdy denizens of the middle class, though his maternal grandparents, who live with the family, have saved the money to help send Paul’s obnoxious older brother to private school), is a kid who drifts through life, getting by on his wits and his talent and his propensity to dream, and not really worrying about anything. Johnny, on the other hand, is a poor kid who lives with his grandmother, and his status as the only Black kid in class makes him an outsider. He and the teacher get into an ongoing psychological war, but Johnny, unlike Paul, doesn’t have the support system that’s going to flick away his mistakes.

Gray stages the scenes set in Paul’s home in a boisterous, everyone-talking-at-the-same-time way, but he’s also cueing us to see the value systems at work — in this case, the crusades and prejudices of outer-borough New York Jewish liberals of the late 20th century. Paul’s grandparents escaped from Europe before the Holocaust but live every day with the awareness of it, as do his folks: his mother, Esther (Anne Hathaway), a high-strung PTA president who’s planning to run for school board, and his father, Irving (Jeremy Strong), a mole-like home repairman who seems like a decent and even corny guy until his famous “temper” bursts out. (When it does, you think: This man has a problem.)

The actors inhabit these roles — Hathaway makes Esther at once affectionate and blinkered, and Strong is meticulous in how he plays the father as a charmless noodge with those pockets of rage, yet if you look hard enough you can see his love there too. Anthony Hopkins, as Paul’s grandfather, brings the film a note of crusty benevolence, though I couldn’t watch his performance without thinking: Why does an actor as great as Hopkins play this aging mensch with the same Welsh purr you’d expect to hear from him on a talk show?

Paul, in his way, is an entitled kid — too entitled, to the extent he feels like he can just pick up the phone and order Chinese dumplings because he doesn’t like what’s being served for dinner that night. But entitlement, as we see, runs in this family. The Grafs pride themselves on being good liberals — they think Ronald Reagan’s candidacy is a horror show — and much of that comes from what they view as their legacy of being Jewish victims of oppression. Yet they’re still the sort of people who think of Black Americans as “the Blacks.” They’re as racist, in their way, as Mr. Turkeltaub. They just don’t know it. We’ve seen plenty of movie scenes, over the years, with noisy ethnic families, but the disorder of this household reflects something — maybe the culture at large starting to come apart.

“Armageddon Time” is an effusive 1980 nostalgia trip. On a class outing to the Guggenheim Museum, Paul sees the Kandinsky canvases hanging there in their psychedelic eye-candy slashes and color bursts, which inspires his art inclinations all the more. Then he and Johnny duck out of the field trip, which allows Gray to give us a tour of 40-year-old analog New York: the subway trains splattered in graffiti, the pinball arcades, the joys of going to Colony Records to buy “Rapper’s Delight” by the Sugarhill Gang. Banks Repeta, who looks like a dewy freckled young Miles Teller, has a gentle wariness the audience hooks right into. His Paul takes in everything but holds most of it inside, a quality that will take him far. Yet his parents fear that he’s failing. (It doesn’t occur to his practical, imagination-impaired father that wanting to be a visual artist isn’t career suicide.) And after Paul is caught smoking a joint with Johnny in the school bathroom, they announce that he’s going to be joining his older brother at private school.

His first day in the gothic hallways, a man in a wormy  mustache stands in the corridor and asks Paul his name. Is this the assistant principal? Actually, it’s Fred Trump (played by the redoubtable John Diehl) — yes, Donald Trump’s father, who susses out that Paul, despite his generic last name, is Jewish. We may think the stage is being set for a junior version of “School Ties,” especially when Paul, in his clip-on tie and insignia jacket, is approached by Topper (played with a scene-stealing smirk by Dane West), a kid who looks like he’s biding his time before he joins a fraternity. But Gray mostly uses the brief scenes at the private school to establish his larger theme: that there are two Americas in place, and that Paul has suddenly been thrust into the elite one. (Fred Trump is a school benefactor.) Whatever he himself believes or thinks he stands for, he’s now part of the corrupt system.

There are ways that things have gotten better since 1980. Yet Gray uses the dawn of the Reagan era (and, in a way, the Trump era) to try and paint a portrait of systemic oppression, with an awareness that hooks into that of our own time. But here’s the trouble with that.

At heart, “Armageddon Time” is an old-school liberal message movie — it’s all about how Paul and Johnny get into trouble, but Johnny is the one who gets thrown under the bus, and we’re supposed to feel bad about that. Yet as a filmmaker, Gray wants to have his compassion and eat it too. Given the fair amount of screen time that Johnny gets, there’s something a little cavalier about how the story just kind of tosses him away. He’s there, in effect, to provide a lesson for Paul — to make him a better person. The story doesn’t so much care about Johnny as use him. Throughout the film, we hear snatches of the title song, which I always found to be a monotonous and preachy latter-day Clash anthem, with Joe Strummer singing about how “A lot of people won’t get no justice tonight.” It sounded au courant back then, but now it sounds like a song driven by a white-savior consciousness, and so, in its way, is “Armageddon Time.” The movie ends with a rebel gesture that feels too much like…a gesture. It’s the perfect sign-off for a drama that cares, but maybe not enough to see that this kind of caring actually became part of the problem.

11,The Bad Guys,https://youtu.be/m8Xt0yXaDPU,https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8Xt0yXaDPU,"Apr 22, 2022",,"In Greater Los Angeles where humans and anthropomorphic animals co-exist, Mr. Wolf leads The Bad Guys, a gang of infamous criminal animals who commit brazen thefts and evade the authorities due to the public's interpretation of them as inherently ""bad"" animals.

After being insulted by Governor Diane Foxington on live television, Wolf convinces his gang to pull off a heist to steal a valuable award called the Golden Dolphin from guinea pig philanthropist Professor Marmalade, during his inauguration at a gala. During the heist, Wolf inadvertently helps an elderly woman and is praised for the good deed, leading to Wolf becoming afflicted by his wrongdoings. After the gang is exposed and arrested as result of a failed attempted escape, Wolf persuades Marmalade with Foxington's approval to reform them, planning to take advantage of the pretense to steal the award again.

Marmalade invites the gang to his home, but they struggle with his lessons, unable to adapt to good behavior. After a ""heist for good"" to rescue a herd of guinea pigs from a research lab fails due to Wolf's second-in-command, Mr. Snake, eating them, Foxington decides to call off the experiment but relents when Wolf confesses that he despises being hated for his species; she admits she understands and has hope for him. Wolf contemplates the matter and finds himself rescuing a cat from a tree, which Marmalade records and publishes, turning the public image of the gang around. However, Snake fears that he is losing touch with his friend.

When the gang execute a new heist to steal the award again during a gala, Wolf cannot bring himself to finish the plan. Suddenly, a meteorite on display is stolen, causing the gang to be blamed for the theft. When they are arrested, Marmalade meets them in private and reveals that he stole the meteorite and had planned for the gang to take the blame (he was the old woman Wolf had helped). In prison, Wolf explains to his gang that he does not want to be a criminal anymore and that they can improve, but Snake refuses, believing that the world will never see them as anything other than monsters. Their fight is interrupted when the Crimson Paw, a notorious criminal, rescues them; revealing herself to be Foxington, who reformed when she attempted to steal the Golden Dolphin herself.

Upon reaching safety, the gang abandons Wolf for betraying them, but when they return to their hideout, they find it completely emptied of their loot, as Wolf revealed its location to Foxington earlier at the gala as compensation for his crimes. After Snake willingly gives Mr. Shark his last possession (a Push Pop) out of kindness, the others realize that they can change their ways and proceed to help Wolf. However, Snake denies it and abandons them to ally with Marmalade, who plans to use the meteorite to power a mind-control device to hypnotize an army of guinea pigs into stealing charity funds.

Meanwhile, Wolf and Foxington break into Marmalade's home to steal the meteorite, only to be captured by Marmalade and Snake. They are rescued by the rest of the gang, then steal the meteorite and proceed to foil Marmalade's heist. They arrive at the police station to turn in the meteorite until they decide to bring Snake back despite his betrayal. During the chase, Marmalade betrays Snake as an advantage and steals the meteorite back.

After destroying Marmalade's mind-control helmet, the gang surrenders to the authorities to prevent Foxington from revealing her former criminal past. Marmalade attempts to take credit for recovering the meteorite, but it is revealed to be a fake planted by Snake, who had faked his defection. He switched it for a meteorite-shaped lamp and overcharged the real one inside Marmalade's basement, causing it to implode the entire manor from afar. When the lamp meteorite falls on Marmalade, a diamond he stole from Foxington falls from his suit, which authorities recognize as having been stolen by the Crimson Paw years ago. Implicated as the Crimson Paw, Marmalade is arrested.

One year later, the gang is released from prison in light of their good behavior, partnering up with Foxington to begin their new crime-fighting careers."

The film begins with a tribute to kaiju cinema, in what appears to be a city being overrun by a giant green monster. In reality, it is Chris Pontius' penis painted green over a small set of a city intercut with the cast members running through a life-size set of the same city. The intro ends with the ""monster"" bitten by a snapping turtle and Johnny Knoxville's intro, ""Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville, welcome to Jackass!""

Stunts and pranks with the main cast include Knoxville facing a bull resulting in dangerous consequences, Steve-O having his penis used as a beehive, Dave England getting pig semen dumped on him, a vulture eating pieces of meat off Wee Man's body, Ehren McGhehey being subjected to painful tests with an athletic cup, Pontius' penis being used as the paddle for paddle ball, and Preston Lacy's testicles being used as a human punching bag. The newcomers are also featured in many of the stunts and pranks, including Poopies fighting off a Texas Ratsnake, Zach Holmes gliding down into a bed of cactuses, Jasper Dolphin being shot off a ramp by large industrial fans while he's holding a parachute, Eric Manaka riding a bicycle full speed into a false wall, and Rachel Wolfson having a scorpion sting her lips.

The final stunt, Vomitron, features Zach, Dave, Eric, Poopies, Steve-O and Jasper drinking milk while strapped to a high-speed carousel. As they start vomiting, Knoxville and the rest of the cast initiate an attack involving paintball guns, a tennis machine and multiple explosions. After assuring the stunt is over, one big explosion is set off, surprising the victims of the stunt."

In the process, he gets injured and crash-lands in 2022. The story then shifts to 12-year-old Adam in 2022, whose father Louis died a year previously. He is bullied at school, gets suspended for fighting in school, and is distant from his mother Ellie. When he is home alone one night, he finds the injured future Adam. The younger Adam refuses to trust the stranger, but future Adam inadvertently mentions the names of both the younger Adam and his dog, Hawking. The younger Adam soon realizes that the stranger in front of him is his future self.

Due to a safety feature preventing him from flying because of his injuries, Adam must bring along the younger Adam and use his DNA to enter his jet. They both are soon attacked by Maya Sorian, the leader of the dystopian world, and her assistant Christos, but are saved by Laura, who had faked her death and stayed off-grid in an unknown location. After surviving the attack and comparing notes, Laura and the Adams realize that after the invention of time travel by Louis Reed and his subsequent death, Sorian had monopolized the discovery. During her visit to 2018, Laura learned Sorian frequently came and advised her past self in order to secure her future wealth and power. To protect her secret, Sorian ordered Laura's death. Although Laura survived the assassination attempt, destruction of her time jet left her stranded in the past. The sudden arrival of Sorian's goons interrupts the reunion, and Laura fights off the attack long enough for the two Adams to escape to 2018.

In 2018, the Adams meet Louis Reed in an attempt to enlist his help, but their father refuses any assistance out of concern for the effect on the time stream. That night, Sorian meets and warns her past self about Adam. Meanwhile, the Adams share their common feelings about their father in a motel. The next day, they both set off to destroy the time travel machine. On arrival at Sorian Technologies, they are attacked by Sorian's soldiers, but are unexpectedly saved by Louis, who has changed his mind and agrees to guide them. Louis reveals that destroying the machine will not destroy time travel as long as Sorian has his algorithm with all the math and constraints to control the process. Meanwhile, 2050 Sorian captures the younger Adam.

Although 2050 Adam and Louis remove a memory unit with the algorithm, both Sorians arrive and threaten the younger Adam as leverage to coerce Louis into surrendering the algorithm. The younger Adam escapes from Sorian by pushing her gun away, however, an errant bullet damages the seal restraining the electromagnetic field, causing it to grow to limitless values. The Reeds try as much as they can to stop them, but the older Sorian threatens to kill Louis. Adam warns that her bullets are armor-piercing, but Louis remains adamant. Seeing no other way, Sorian shoots at Louis, but the bullet deviates and hits the younger Sorian instead, killing her and wiping the older Sorian out of existence.

The Reeds barely manage to escape the facility's implosion and reach home, where they reconcile by playing a game of catch before the Adams return to their respective timelines. In 2022, the younger Adam lives in a new timeline where his suspensions never happened, has let go of his anger, and gives his mother a hug via an ""echo"". Sometime in the future, an older and much happier Adam meets Laura during a flight training lecture where she realizes she has entered the wrong building on the campus. After Adam offers to walk her to her building, stating that he has got time, they depart together."

One day at the supermarket, a man named Steve flirts with her and they exchange numbers. On their first date, the two quickly hit it off and have sex. After several dates, Steve invites Noa for a weekend break away alone with him. Against the advice of her best friend Mollie, Noa agrees to the trip. Planning to travel early the following day, Noa spends the evening at Steve's luxury home. Steve drugs Noa's cocktail and she falls unconscious.

Noa wakes up in captivity, chained to the ground. Steve explains that he is a butcher of human meat, which he sells to wealthy clients for consumption and eats himself. They prefer the meat of young women, so he regularly lures and abducts women on dates. He says that he will keep Noa alive as long as possible in order to keep her meat fresh as he surgically removes different pieces of her body. Steve allows Noa to take a shower, but she tries to escape. Steve captures her and harvests her buttocks as punishment. Noa speaks to a woman named Penny who is being held captive in an adjacent room.

Meanwhile, Mollie becomes concerned about Noa's disappearance and begins investigating with her friend Paul, a bartender who served Noa and Steve drinks on their first date. Searching online, Mollie discovers Steve is actually named Brendan, and is married to a woman named Ann with whom he has children. Believing he is having an affair, Mollie visits Ann and informs her of her suspicions. During their conversation, Brendan arrives, and when confronted by Mollie denies any knowledge of Noa. As she leaves, Mollie calls Noa's phone, which begins ringing in Brendan's pocket. Ann, revealed to be Brendan's accomplice, knocks Mollie unconscious. It is revealed that Ann has a prosthetic leg and was one of Brendan's victims before he fell for her.

Noa gains Brendan's trust by flirting and pretending to be interested in what human meat tastes like. Brendan invites her to dinner and persuades her to taste a lavish meal containing human meat, which Noa pretends to appreciate; she later vomits in her cell. Meanwhile, Brendan takes Mollie away for harvesting. Brendan invites Noa to another dinner, providing her with a pink dress as a gift. Before dinner, Brendan shows Noa a hidden compartment filled with items belonging to the victims. He feeds Noa breast meat, which Brendan connotes as possibly tasting ""familiar."" Noa recognises Mollie's phone among the stolen victims' phones. Following dinner, Noa persuades Brendan to have sex with her and let her perform fellatio on him; she instead bites off his testicles. With Brendan injured but in pursuit, Noa helps Mollie and Penny escape from their rooms.

The three encounter Brendan in the kitchen and fight him, then escape into the woods with Brendan pursuing them with a gun. They manage to attack him again, with Noa taking the gun and shooting Brendan dead. Ann arrives at the house and finds Brendan's body. She encounters Noa in the woods and tries to strangle her, but Noa stabs Ann in the neck with car keys. As Ann recovers and attempts to strangle Noa again, Mollie bludgeons Ann with a shovel. As she and Mollie relax at last, Noa receives a text from a man she went out with at the beginning of the film.

A mid-credits scene depicts five of Brendan's clients in a white room, seated at a table with bleeding human meat at the center. A Satanic symbol is displayed during the end credits, indicating that Brendan and his clients are part of a Satanist organisation."

Sonic plans to have fun while home alone but is attacked by Robotnik, who has returned with the help of Knuckles the Echidna. Knuckles desires to honor the legacy of his extinct tribe and demands the location of the legendary Master Emerald, an ancient relic that allows its possessor to bend reality to their will.

Sonic is rescued by Miles ""Tails"" Prower, a two-tailed fox who idolizes him and comes to warn him about Knuckles. Sonic convinces Tails to help him find the Master Emerald, while Robotnik reunites with his assistant Stone and, scheming to steal the emerald, offers to help Knuckles.

Initially hesitant, Briggs agrees when his commanding officer, Jones, promises to recommend him for the position.

On the road, when Briggs stops at a shooting range, Lulu breaks out of her cage and destroys the inside of his 1984 Ford Bronco. Frustrated, Briggs hides sedatives in a hot dog, causing Lulu to fall asleep after she eats it.

The next morning, Briggs and Lulu hitchhike to Nogales in time for the funeral, where Briggs stays with her to keep her calm during the traditional rifle salute. Afterwards, while Briggs gets his truck repaired, he calls Jones and tells him that Lulu's condition has improved, but Jones is unconcerned. Briggs drives into the desert and encourages Lulu to run away, but when she doesn't, they stay in a motel overnight. Briggs suffers from a seizure, but is calmed by Lulu.

Fifteen years later, Nate works as a bartender in New York City and pickpockets wealthy patrons. Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan, a fortune hunter who worked with Sam tracking treasure hidden by the Magellan crew, explains to Nate that Sam vanished after helping him steal Juan Sebastian Elcano's diary. Nate, having stopped receiving postcards from Sam, agrees to help Sully find him. Sully and Nate go to an auction to steal a golden cross linked to the Magellan crew, where they meet Santiago Moncada, the last descendant of the Moncada family, who had financed Magellan‘s expedition, and Jo Braddock, leader of Moncada's mercenaries. Nate is ambushed by Braddock's men, and the ensuing fight creates a distraction for Sully to steal the cross.

As Filipino naval units arrive, Nate and Sully get away with a few pieces of pickpocketed treasure while an arriving Chloe is left empty handed. Meanwhile, an imprisoned Sam writes another postcard to Nate.

In a post-credits scene, Nate meets with a man working for Roman, offering his ring for a ""Nazi map"" he has. He tries to betray Nate, but Sully saves him. They escape, but are caught by an unseen figure."
18,Scream,https://youtu.be/beToTslH17s,https://www.youtube.com/embed/beToTslH17s,"Jan 14, 2022",,"Twenty-five years after Billy Loomis and Stu Macher's killing spree in Woodsboro, high school student Tara Carpenter is home alone when she is attacked by Ghostface and left hospitalized.

In Modesto, Tara's estranged older sister Sam Carpenter is informed by Wes Hicks, one of Tara's friends, about the attack. Sam returns to Woodsboro with her boyfriend Richie Kirsch to visit Tara at the hospital, where Sam is reunited with Tara's friend group: Wes, Amber Freeman, and twins Chad and Mindy Meeks-Martin. That night, Chad's girlfriend Liv Mckenzie's ex-boyfriend Vince Schneider, who is Stu Macher's nephew, is killed by Ghostface outside a bar. At the hospital, Sam is attacked by Ghostface. After escaping, she tells Tara that she has been dealing with hallucinations of Billy Loomis, who Sam learned as a teenager was her biological father. Sam's true parentage resulted in their parents' separation and this is why Sam became estranged from Tara.

Sam and Richie visit Dewey Riley, who is divorced from Gale Weathers. They ask for his help in stopping the killer, and he contacts Gale and Sidney Prescott, warning them about the return of Ghostface. Dewey joins them at Mindy and Chad's home and is reunited with the twins' mother Martha, Randy Meeks' sister. Due to the three attacks having targeted people related to the original killers, Sam is accused of being the killer. Ghostface then murders Wes and his mother, Sheriff Judy Hicks, at their home. There, Dewey reunites with Gale, who has arrived in town to cover the story. At the hospital, Tara and Richie are attacked by Ghostface but are saved by Dewey and Sam; Dewey is killed when he attempts to finish off Ghostface.

Sidney arrives in town after learning of Dewey's death and meets both Gale and Sam at the hospital. Sidney asks Sam to help stop the killer, but Sam declines. She chooses to leave town with Richie and Tara, but they are forced to stop at Amber's house to retrieve an inhaler for Tara. Sidney and Gale follow them to the house, which is revealed to be Stu's former home where the original Woodsboro massacre took place. There, Chad and Mindy are both attacked by Ghostface. As Sam tends to an injured Mindy, Amber pulls out a gun and shoots Liv in the head, revealing herself as Ghostface. Fleeing in the basement, Richie speculates to Sam that Tara is Amber's accomplice. Sam leaves him to find Tara and discovers her tied up in a closet.

When Gale and Sidney arrive, Amber shoots and injures Gale. Richie then stabs Sam and reveals himself to be Amber's partner. Richie and Amber take Sam, Sidney, and Gale into the kitchen where they reveal they are fans of the Stab film series who met online. Disappointed in the trajectory taken with the most-recent Stab 8, they decided to embark on a new killing spree, bringing back the ""original cast"" to provide new-and-improved ""source material"" for a future ""requel"" Stab film and intend to frame Sam as the killer. After Tara fights Amber and Sam attacks Richie, Gale breaks free and shoots Amber, who lands on the stove and is set on fire. Sam is injured but sees another hallucination of Billy, which brings her attention to Amber's abandoned knife. Embracing her paternal heritage, she uses the knife to stab Richie repeatedly before shooting and killing him. A horribly burnt Amber attempts to attack the group again but is shot to death by Tara.

Tara and the Meeks twins are loaded into ambulances to be taken to the hospital, and Sam thanks Sidney and Gale for their help. Gale refuses to write about the new murders and gives the killers notoriety, opting to write a tribute to Dewey instead. Sam joins Tara in the ambulance and the night's events are covered in a news report."
19,Men,https://youtu.be/pt81CJcWZy8,https://www.youtube.com/embed/pt81CJcWZy8,"May 20, 2022",,"Harper Marlowe decides to spend a holiday alone in the small village of Cotson following the apparent suicide of her husband James. In flashbacks, it is revealed that Harper, fed up with James' emotional abuse and manipulation, intended to divorce him, leading James to threaten her with his suicide. After James hit her, Harper locked him out of the flat before witnessing him fall from an upstairs balcony to his death, being partially impaled by a fence.

Harper arrives at the spacious manor house she is renting and is welcomed by its owner Geoffrey. She later goes for a walk in the woods and stumbles upon an old disused railway tunnel. A figure appears at the distant end of the tunnel and begins walking towards her, but she manages to evade it. Reaching an open field, she takes a picture of an abandoned building with her phone, inadvertently capturing a naked man standing near it and staring at her. Later, during a video call with her friend Riley, Harper notices the man in her garden and calls the police; the man is arrested, with one of the arresting officers looking like Geoffrey. Afterwards, Harper visits a church, where images of the Green Man and Sheela na gig are carved on a font, and meets a young boy and a vicar who both bear a likeness to Geoffrey. The boy calls her ""bitch"" when she declines his invitation to play hide and seek; and the vicar insinuates that Harper might be partially to blame for James' death because she didn't allow him to apologise. Upset, she goes to the village pub on Geoffrey's recommendation. There are few patrons in the pub, and they and the bartender all bear Geoffrey's appearance. Geoffrey is also there, his policeman lookalike arrives a short time later. The policeman informs Harper that the naked man has been released in the absence of any legal ground to keep him detained, to her incredulity and chagrin.

She contacts Riley about the day's developments, and Riley agrees to drive to the village in the morning so that Harper can continue her holidays at the cottage. As Harper attempts to send Riley the address, her mobile phone's service is repeatedly interrupted. She sees the policeman in her garden, but as the lights flicker, he changes into one of the pub patrons and then chases her inside the house. Harper defends herself with a knife before a window breaks in the kitchen. Geoffrey arrives and finds that the window breaking has been due to a crow, which he then euthanises by breaking its neck. As Geoffrey goes into the garden to check for any would-be intruders, he is replaced with the naked man, who chases Harper again. When he tries to reach his hand through the letter box in the front door, Harper stabs him through the arm. He manages to pull his arm free, the stuck knife ripping his arm in two in an injury resembling the one James received during his fall. Both the boy and the vicar appear in the house, each of them now similarly injured. The vicar attempts to molest Harper, but she stabs him in the stomach and leaves the house.

While attempting to drive away, Harper runs over Geoffrey. In a rage he throws Harper out of her car and drives away, circles back around, and chases Harper down before crashing the car into a stone wall in front of the house. The naked man, now in full Green Man form, approaches Harper, his ankle now severely broken and matching another injury on James's corpse. The naked man violently gives birth to the young boy, who in turn gives birth to the vicar, then Geoffrey, and finally James, heavily mutilating their bodies. Both James and Harper sit on a couch inside the house, with him continuing to blame her for his death. When Harper asks him what he wants from her, James responds that he wants her love. Shortly afterwards Riley arrives at the house and is revealed to be pregnant. Shocked at the blood trail leading into the house, Riley finds Harper sitting in the garden, alive and smiling when she sees her."
20,Death on the Nile,https://youtu.be/dZRqB0JLizw,https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZRqB0JLizw,"Feb 11, 2022",,"In World War I, a young Hercule Poirot devises a strategy to advance his Belgian infantry company, but a booby trap mutilates his face. His fiancée, nurse Katherine, does not recoil, but says he will grow a mustache to hide his scars.

In 1937 at a London club, Poirot watches as blues singer Salome Otterbourne performs. He notices Jacqueline ""Jackie"" de Bellefort is there with her fiancé Simon Doyle. Jackie's childhood friend, heiress Linnet Ridgeway, soon arrives. After meeting Simon, Linnet agrees to hire him as her land agent.

Six weeks later, in Egypt, Poirot encounters his friend Bouc and Bouc's mother, Euphemia, an artist. Bouc invites Poirot to join them at the hotel to celebrate the wedding of a surprising couple – Linnet and Simon. Others join their honeymoon trip: Linnet's maid, Louise Bourget; Salome and her niece/manager, Rosalie, Linnet's schoolfriend; Linnet's godmother, Marie Van Schuyler with her nurse, Mrs. Bowers; Linnet's financial manager and cousin, Andrew Katchadourian; and Dr. Linusé Windlesham. Linnet asks Poirot for protection from the obsessive Jackie, who has stalked the couple to Egypt; Poirot cannot dissuade Jackie, who shows him she carries a gun.

To escape Jackie, the group boards the cruise ship S.S. Karnak. Linnet tells Poirot she distrusts her guests. During an excursion to Abu Simbel, Bouc reveals he is dating Rosalie, despite his mother's disapproval; Poirot finds himself attracted to Salome. After a boulder falls off a column and nearly crushes Linnet and Simon, the guests return to the Karnak to discover Jackie has boarded. Poirot, affected by champagne, confides to Jackie that he renounced romance after Katherine died in a mortar explosion. Linnet goes to bed and Simon confronts Jackie, who shoots him in the leg. When she attempts to shoot herself, Rosalie and Bouc intervene. They take Jackie to Mrs. Bowers, while Windlesham arrives to treat Simon. The following morning, Louise discovers Linnet has been fatally shot in the head and her valuable necklace stolen.

Poirot, assisted by Simon and Bouc, interrogates the guests, who each bear a grudge against Linnet or would benefit from her death:

Louise's engagement was ended by Linnet, who distrusted Louise's fiancé.
Windlesham was engaged to Linnet until she left him for Simon.
Andrew was embezzling from Linnet.
Bowers' formerly wealthy family was ruined by Linnet's father during the Great Depression.
Van Schuyler is a beneficiary of Linnet's will. She and Bowers are lovers.
Salome was the target of Linnet's racist remarks, years ago.
Euphemia finds Linnet's necklace. Poirot suspects she resented Linnet for introducing Bouc to Rosalie.
Jackie was monitored by Bowers all night. Her gun is dredged from the Nile, wrapped in Van Schuyler's missing scarf and a bloody handkerchief.

Poirot reveals that Euphemia hired him to investigate Rosalie, whom, he concludes, is more than worthy of her son's affection. Rosalie, angry at being investigated, storms off and discovers Louise's body, her throat slit. Louise is found with money, so Poirot suspects that she witnessed Linnet's murder and blackmailed the killer. He sees a possible witness' outline in the blood spatter. Interrogating Bouc with Simon, Poirot deduces that Bouc found Linnet dead and stole her necklace to gain financial freedom from his mother, but panicked and put it in Euphemia's belongings. Bouc witnessed Louise's murder, but before revealing the killer, he is shot dead; Poirot chases the killer, but only finds the abandoned gun.

Locking the surviving guests in the boat's saloon, Poirot reveals that Simon killed Linnet, with Jackie as his accomplice and the mastermind. They are still lovers and arranged Simon's romance with Linnet to inherit her wealth. Simon drugged Poirot's champagne and Jackie pretended to shoot Simon with a blank. Simon faked his injury with paint stolen from Euphemia. While Jackie distracted Bouc and Rosalie, Simon killed Linnet and, returning to the saloon, shot his own leg, muffled by Van Schuyler's scarf. Jackie killed Louise with Windlesham's scalpel, and Bouc with Andrew's gun. Faced with Poirot's irrefutable proof, Jackie embraces Simon and shoots him through the back, killing them both with one shot. As the passengers disembark, Poirot is unable to voice his feelings to Salome.

Six months later, Poirot visits her club to watch her rehearse, sitting alone in the dark and unrecognized by the club owner due to his clean-shaven face."
21,Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,https://youtu.be/Y9dr2zw-TXQ,https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9dr2zw-TXQ,"Apr 15, 2022",,"Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald briefly meet in a Muggle teashop, and acknowledge their feelings for one another. Grindelwald vows to destroy the Muggle world, but Dumbledore denounces the plan as madness, saying he once supported it only because he was young and foolish.

In Kweilin, China, 1932, Newt Scamander helps a Qilin — a magical creature that can see into one's soul as well as the future — give birth. Grindelwald's acolytes, led by Credence Barebone, attack and kill the mother and kidnap the newborn. Grindelwald subsequently kills the creature intending to harness its ability of precognition. However, unbeknownst to them, the Qilin had twins, the younger of which Newt saved.

Unable to battle Grindelwald due to their blood pact, Albus Dumbledore recruits Newt, Newt's brother Theseus, Ilvermorny Charms teacher Lally Hicks, Senegalese-French wizard Yusuf Kama, American No-Maj Jacob Kowalski, and Newt's assistant Bunty Broadacre to thwart Grindelwald's plan for world domination. They travel to Berlin, Germany where Yusuf is planted as a spy in Grindelwald's inner circle. Grindelwald has his convert, Queenie Goldstein, use legilimency to test Yusuf's trustworthiness. The International Confederation of Wizards (ICW) acquits Grindelwald of all previous criminal charges, allowing for his candidacy as Supreme Mugwump of (the Head of) the ICW, despite Dumbledore's attempts to otherwise persuade current Supreme Mugwump Anton Vogel.

Meanwhile, Grindelwald's acolytes, who have undermined the German Ministry of Magic, arrest Theseus and plot to assassinate the Brazilian Supreme Mugwump candidate, Vicência Santos. Dumbledore dispatches Newt to the Erkstag, the secret German wizarding prison where Theseus is held. Lally and Jacob successfully prevent the assassination. They escape but Jacob is framed for attempting to murder Grindelwald, who then justifies Wizards suppressing all Muggles. Meanwhile, Credence battles Albus Dumbledore, who quickly defeats him. Credence learns he is the illegitimate son of Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus Dumbledore's brother. Credence then questions his loyalty to Grindelwald. Elsewhere, Newt and Theseus escape the Erkstag and use a Portkey to transport to Hogwarts.

Wizarding world leaders gather in Bhutan for the Walk of the Qilin ritual, where a Qilin selects a worthy new Supreme Mugwump. Grindelwald foresees Dumbledore and Newt smuggling the surviving twin Qilin to the ceremony in a suitcase. To thwart Grindelwald's cohorts, each Dumbledore ally carries an identical suitcase. As the team moves through the village, Queenie, renouncing Grindelwald, reunites with Jacob.

Using necromancy, Grindelwald reanimates the dead Qilin and manipulates it to choose him during the Supreme Mugwump selection ceremony. Grindelwald immediately declares war on all Muggles and tortures Jacob. However, Credence, Newt, and Bunty expose him. Bunty produces the surviving Qilin which bows to Dumbledore, who declines the position. Santos is then chosen as the new Supreme Mugwump. Enraged, Grindelwald tries to kill Credence by casting the killing curse, but Credence is simultaneously protected by Aberforth (his father) and Albus (his uncle). Dumbledore's and Grindelwald's clashing spells break the blood pact. Their ensuing battle reaches a stalemate, and Grindelwald disapparates.

In the aftermath, Aberforth accepts the ailing Credence as his son and takes him home. Jacob and Queenie marry at Jacob's bakery shop in New York City, with most of the group and Tina Goldstein in attendance. Newt spots Dumbledore watching from across the street. Dumbledore thanks Newt before disappearing into the night."

To promote the latest book on Lovemore, her publisher, Beth Hatten, insists that Loretta embark on a book tour with Alan Caprison, the book's cover model for Dash, despite her reclusiveness since the death of her husband.

After a disastrous start, mostly due to the popularity of Alan's Dash persona, Loretta is taken by Abigail Fairfax, a billionaire who realizes that Loretta based her books on actual historic research she did with her late archaeologist husband. He discovered a lost city on a remote Atlantic island and is convinced the Crown of Fire, a priceless treasure, is located there. When she declines to help decipher an ancient map to the treasure, Fairfax, fearing an active volcano will destroy the site, chloroforms and takes Loretta to the island.

Alan, who is secretly enamored with Loretta, witnesses her kidnapping. He recruits Jack Trainer, a former Navy SEAL turned CIA operative, to meet him on the island and coordinate a rescue. Jack, with no assistance from Alan, breaches Fairfax's compound and frees Loretta, but is shot dead before they can make it to the airport, forcing Loretta and Alan to escape into the jungle.

Loretta and Alan spend a day fighting off Fairfax's men before reaching a nearby village, where upon hearing a folk song from a local, Loretta deduces that the crown is hidden in a cenote in the jungle. Before they can leave however, Fairfax captures her again, so a chase by Alan to save Loretta ensues. The two are then forced to share the treasure's location with Fairfax.

Upon reaching the location, they discover the tomb is not a monument to Taha and Calaman's power, but a hiding place for the queen to grieve for her husband. Her Crown of Fire was made of red seashells gathered by him as a sign of his love for her. The actual treasure of the legend was not a priceless jewel but the inseparable love between the king and queen.

Infuriated, Fairfax forces Loretta and Alan into the tomb as the volcano erupts, but Rafi, one of the men, has a change of heart and leaves a crowbar to help them escape before abandoning Fairfax on the island. Beth arrives with the local coast guard and Fairfax is arrested. Loretta's next book, based on her adventure with Alan, is a hit, and they share a kiss at the end of their next book tour.

In a mid-credits scene, Loretta and Alan attend a yoga class and find out that Jack survived being shot."

Though initially hesitant, Will agrees after Danny reaffirms that he is doing this for Amy. The plan nearly succeeds until Officer Zach Parker, who goes to the bank to ask out a bank teller, discovers the situation and is held hostage by Danny. A shootout then occurs between one of the heist members and Zach's partner Officer Mark. The Special Investigation Section (SIS) of the LAPD arrives and shoots down the whole crew except Will and Danny, who retreat towards the garage. Zach attempts to escape and during a scuffle between him and Danny, he is accidentally shot by Will. Leaving Zach to die, the brothers attempt to exit through the back of the building but find it surrounded by police. They then hijack an ambulance with EMT Cam Thompson on board, who is treating the injured Zach. After a chase that leads them into an alleyway, Cam makes a desperate attempt to escape using a fire extinguisher but decides to stay when Zach starts flatlining.

SIS Captain Monroe arrives on the scene and deploys helicopters to chase after the ambulance. Cam gets Danny to help her use a defibrillator and Will to transfer some of his blood to Zach, much to his confusion and frustration. Danny then calls Papi, one of his adoptive father's criminal friends, for help losing the police in exchange for $8 million. When Cam stops Danny from shooting Mark, who has been chasing them, Danny threatens to throw her off the ambulance. The police are forced to retreat when it is discovered that Monroe's dog is inside Mark's police vehicle. FBI Agent Anson Clark, a past friend of Danny's, is put on the case. Zach begins to bleed out; Cam, with Will's assistance, begins to perform surgery on Zach, whose spleen ruptures. Despite her inexperience, Cam successfully performs the surgery. Cam tries to convince Will to stop Danny, to no avail. Monroe, unaware of the surgery's success, moves forward with the operation and prepares to snipe Will and Danny without negotiating for Cam's life. Clark calls Cam and tells her to get down. Cam, wanting to save Zach's life, alerts Will and Danny about the snipers. Danny, having had enough of Cam, decides to shoot her but Will intervenes, causing the brothers to fight about their predicament. They later partially reconcile and listen to music together to ease the tension.

In the Los Angeles River, helicopters chase the ambulance as Danny shoots at them. Will and Danny then drive on the opposite lane of the interstate, creating multiple accidents. On Papi's orders, his son, Roberto, drives an empty ambulance towards the police after filling it with C-4 explosives and deploys machine guns on separate cars to cause additional damage, which ends up killing Monroe in the crossfire. Mark chases down Roberto and kills him after a scuffle, leaving Papi angry and distraught. Will and Danny escape to Papi's hideout. Papi demands the brothers to leave Zach and Cam with them to deal with; Will refuses to cooperate and teams up with Danny to kill Papi and his crew. In the chaos, Cam accidentally shoots Will using Zach's gun. Danny takes the ambulance to a hospital and discovers Zach's gun. He is enraged when Cam reveals that she was the one who shot Will. Danny vows to kill Cam along with himself on live television, before confronting the police. Will, left with no other choice, shoots Danny in the back. Danny apologizes to Will before he dies from his injuries. The police arrest a heavily injured Will and take him inside for surgery, Cam secretly gives some of the heist money to Amy for her surgery, and Zach, when questioned by the police about his injuries, tells them that Will saved his life."
24,All the Old Knives,https://youtu.be/6s7NziAetNs,https://www.youtube.com/embed/6s7NziAetNs,"Apr 8, 2022",,"In early 2020, CIA officer Henry Pelham is informed by his boss, Vick Wallinger, that the CIA has reopened the case of Turkish Alliance 127, a 2012 terrorist hijacking which ended in tragedy. Headquarters suspects there was a leak from the Vienna station, where Henry and Vick work. Henry is sent to interview Celia Harrison, who also worked at the Vienna station at the time of the hijacking. Henry and Celia were lovers, but she left him shortly after the event.

Celia, now retired, lives in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California with her family. Henry meets her at an upscale restaurant, which is almost empty of customers and staff. As Henry and Celia talk, she reveals that an Austrian intelligence agent named Karl Stein approached her shortly after she moved to Carmel. He wanted her to inform on her coworkers, but she refused. Henry has Celia recall the events of the hijacking.

In a flashback to 2012, Flight 127 is on the runway when it is hijacked by four armed militants belonging to an Islamic terrorist group. The Vienna station jumps into action to address the crisis and learns that Ilyas Shushani, a Chechen and former informant for Henry, may be involved. The hijackers threaten to kill the passengers unless several of their comrades are released from custody. Ahmed, a CIA courier who happened to be on the plane, contacts the CIA and suggests an attack via the plane's undercarriage. Celia connects with a possible source named Mohammed, but the meeting seems to yield nothing of value. Henry tells Celia and her mentor, Bill Compton, that when Henry worked in Moscow his superiors forced him to betray Ilyas to the Russian government to placate them after a terrorist attack.

The Vienna station receives another message from Ahmed saying that the terrorists have a camera mounted on the plane's undercarriage and the assault should be called off. Celia notices differences in the language of Ahmed's messages and fears he has been compromised. Checking the station's phone logs, she notices that a call to Iran was placed from Bill's office phone. Then Ahmed is killed and thrown off the plane. The next day, Celia leaves both Henry and Vienna.

In the present, Henry asks why she ended their relationship so abruptly. Celia reveals that she saw a call on Henry's cellphone from the same Iranian number that she found in the station phone logs. It is revealed that when the terrorists' demands were not met, they released sarin gas, killing themselves, the crew, and all passengers. The Vienna station is devastated by the outcome. Realizing that Henry was the leak, she left him but did not divulge her discovery to the CIA.

She further confesses that, after Henry contacted her to arrange this meeting, she contacted Karl Stein, and he arranged the meeting place, the staff, and fake customers, with the aim of poisoning Henry via his wine.

As Henry begins to succumb to the poison, Celia tearfully asks why he betrayed everyone to the terrorists. He explains that he was lured into a meeting with Ilyas, who had become radicalized and masterminded the hijacking. Ilyas' people staged the meeting between Mohammed and Celia to create the impression that Celia's life was in danger. This pushed Henry into revealing the presence of Ahmed on the plane, as well as the plan for an undercarriage assault in exchange for her life.

Henry comes to terms with his impending death, and Celia returns home to her husband and children. Karl calls Vick to report that Henry has died, revealing that they had been working together the entire time."

She escapes rehab and drives to Salt Lake City. While stopped in the middle of the road, Corporal Ron Hill tells her that the interstate is closed because of a developing blizzard. She agrees to stay overnight at a local visitor's center. The only people inside are Ash, Lars, and married couple Ed and Sandi. Darby goes outside to look for cellphone signal and ends up discovering a kidnapped girl in a van belonging to one of the people inside.

Playing a round of Bullshit, Darby uses her knowledge of the van's license plate to question the others and deduce that Lars is the kidnapper. She goes to the bathroom and uses a hole in the wall to go back outside. Darby breaks into the van and talks to the girl, promising to save her. Unaware of her presence, Lars enters the van and reveals the girl's name to be Jay. Inside, Ed grows suspicious of Lars's strange behavior. As Lars exits the van to bring Jay some food, Darby goes back inside the cabin through the hole in the wall.

Jay has Addison's disease, which can cause an adrenaline overdose if she becomes too stressed. In the bathroom, Darby tells Ash about Jay. Ash agrees to help her. When Darby goes outside, however, Ash reveals that he is Lars's brother and an accomplice in the kidnapping. Ash takes Darby back inside and threatens to kill her if she informs Ed and Sandi about Jay. Outside, Jay cuts herself free and runs into the woods. In the bathroom, Darby attacks Ash, but he gains the upper hand. Lars goes through the hole in the wall and stops his brother from strangling Darby. In the struggle, Darby takes Ash's keys.

Ash and Lars force Darby to help them look for Jay. They reveal that they are transporting her to their Uncle Kenny, who runs a human trafficking ring. Darby uses a flashlight to blind the kidnappers and runs away. Ash fires his firearm, alerting Ed and Sandi. Ed and Sandi find Jay unconscious in the snow. Darby goes inside the cabin and tells Ed and Sandi about the kidnappers. After locking the entrance, Ed negotiates with Ash and Lars. He promises to give them the car keys if they give Jay the medicine she needs to survive. As Darby hides the keys, Ash and Lars cover the cabin in gasoline. Jay wakes up and identifies Sandi as her maid. A flashback reveals that Sandi helped Ash and Lars take Jay from her home. She agreed to meet with the kidnappers to give them Jay's medicine. In the present, Sandi lets Ash and Lars inside.

After learning that Darby is the only person who knows where the keys are, Ash kills Ed and Sandi and uses a nail gun to staple Darby to a wall. Her phone receives a text message; Ash reads it and informs her that her mother has died. Another text reveals that Corporal Ron is on his way to the cabin. When Ash threatens to hurt Jay, Darby reveals the key's whereabouts. Ash gives his gun to Lars before leaving to search for the keys. Darby tells Jay to turn off the lights.

Darby snorts cocaine to give herself the strength to pull the nail out of her hand. With Lars distracted, she takes his gun as Ash returns. After Ash accidentally kills his brother by shooting him in the head with the nail gun, Darby and Jay run outside to make their escape. Ash punctures their vehicle and sets the cabin on fire. After Corporal Ron arrives, Darby shoots Ash while Ron shoots Darby. Ash takes her weapon and shoots Ron dead. As he prepares to kill Darby, she uses a screwdriver to puncture his neck, killing him. Darby uses Ron's radio to call for help. In a flash-forward, Darby's sister Devon visits her in rehab."
26,Jurassic World: Dominion,https://youtu.be/DtQycgMD4HQ,https://www.youtube.com/embed/DtQycgMD4HQ,"Jun 10, 2022",,"Four years after the Lockwood Estate incident and the cataclysmic volcanic eruption on Isla Nublar,[a] de-extinct dinosaurs freely roam the earth, causing ecological disasters and deadly animal attacks. Amid global efforts to control the invasive species, Biosyn Genetics established a dinosaur preserve in Italy's Dolomite Mountains where they conduct genomics research, ostensibly seeking groundbreaking pharmacological and agronomic applications.

Claire Dearing, Zia Rodriguez, and Franklin Webb are still with the Dinosaur Protection Group and investigate illegal dinosaur breeding sites and Claire's partner, Owen Grady, works as a wrangler, helping to relocate stray dinosaurs. At their remote cabin in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Claire and Owen secretly raise 14-year-old Maisie Lockwood, Benjamin Lockwood's biogenetic granddaughter, while protecting her from genetic research corporations, who would study her DNA for various nefarious schemes. When Owen's trained Velociraptor, Blue, unexpectedly arrives with an asexually-reproduced hatchling, Maisie names it Beta. Having grown increasingly frustrated living in seclusion, Maisie sneaks away from Claire and Owen, unaware that Biosyn operatives have located her. They abduct her and capture Beta.

Elsewhere, formerly extinct giant locusts have inexplicably reappeared in massive swarms, wiping out crops. Paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler observes that corporate-grown crops using Biosyn seeds are left uneaten, raising suspicions they created the locusts. Believing the locust may date to the Cretaceous period, Ellie approaches former partner and paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant for help. Franklin, now with the CIA's dinosaur unit, tells Claire and Owen that Maisie and Beta were likely taken to Malta. They arrive and infiltrate a dinosaur black market. When authorities launch a raid, four Atrociraptor's are unleashed, causing havoc. Barry Sembène, Owen's former Jurassic World colleague who is working undercover in Malta, informs Claire and Owen that Maisie and Beta are being transported to Biosyn's secluded Italian research facility. Kayla Watts, a sympathetic cargo pilot, flies Claire and Owen there.

Chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm, now working for Biosyn, has sought Ellie's help to expose CEO Dr. Lewis Dodgson's illegal activities after being tipped off by communications director Ramsay Cole. It is revealed that company geneticist, Dr. Henry Wu, genetically engineered the locusts to avoid Biosyn crops as a means to control the world's food supply. Wu now denounces this plan, citing it will cause global famine as the locusts spread unchecked. Wu meets Maisie and explains that Dr. Charlotte Lockwood, Benjamin Lockwood's deceased daughter and Wu's former colleague, used her own DNA to asexually conceive and give birth to the genetically-identical Maisie. She altered Maisie's DNA to prevent her inheriting a fatal disease she had. Wu believes that the asexual conceptions of Maisie and Beta, along with their DNA, are key to creating a pathogen that can halt the locust outbreak.

A Quetzalcoatlus attacks Kayla's plane in Biosyn's airspace, causing Owen and Kayla to crash land while Claire ejects. Following separate encounters with a Therizinosaurus and a Pyroraptor, the three regroup. Inside Biosyn, Ellie and Alan access a restricted lab and steal a locust sample. They encounter Maisie, who leaves with them. Discovering the breach, Dodgson incinerates the locusts to destroy evidence, but many escape, sparking a forest fire and forcing a site-wide evacuation.

Alan, Ellie, and Maisie barely escape and rejoin with Ian, Owen, Claire, and Kayla. Dodgson flees with dinosaur embryos via a hyperloop, but he becomes trapped in a tunnel and is subsequently killed by three Dilophosaurus. Electronic implants summon the dinosaurs to protect them from the fire, while Owen locates and tranquilizes Beta. A Giganotosaurus threatens the group but is fatally attacked by a Therizinosaurus and the first park's veteran Tyrannosaurus rex. The group escapes with Wu in a Biosyn helicopter. Ellie and Alan rekindle their relationship before testifying alongside Ian and Ramsay against Biosyn. Owen, Claire, and Maisie return home and reunite Beta with Blue. Wu manufactures and releases a pathogen to eradicate the locusts. Around the world, dinosaurs adapt to a new co-existence with modern creatures while the United Nations declares Biosyn Valley a dinosaur sanctuary."
27,Hotel Transylvania: Transformania,https://youtu.be/6suJohjIvfo,https://www.youtube.com/embed/6suJohjIvfo,"Jan 14, 2022",,"During the celebration of the 125th anniversary of Hotel Transylvania, Mavis overhears Dracula's plans to retire and leave the hotel to her and Johnny. She tells Johnny who excitedly tells Dracula his plans to renovate the hotel. Worried about Johnny ruining the hotel, Dracula lies to him saying that there is a ""monster real-estate law"" which only lets monsters own the hotel, disappointing Johnny.

Van Helsing decides to help Johnny using a ray that turns humans into monsters and vice-versa; after testing it on his guinea pig Gigi, he uses it on Johnny who turns into a dragon-like monster. Learning about monster Johnny, Dracula tries to turn him back to normal, but accidentally turns himself into a human and breaks the ray's crystal. Van Helsing tells Dracula and Johnny that they can still turn themselves back to normal by getting a new crystal which lies in the Cave of Reflexion in South America, so Dracula and Johnny set off to do so.

Dracula's friends Frank, Wayne, Griffin and Murray end up becoming humans as well, as a result of drinking from a fountain that was contaminated by the ray. Mavis and Ericka confront Van Helsing after learning about Dracula and Johnny's whereabouts in the news, but he warns them about the effects of the ray, as humans who become monsters continue to mutate and become more hostile as time goes on. With this in mind, the rest of the gang head to South America to find Dracula and Johnny.

While traveling through the South American jungle, Dracula and Johnny begin to bond, and Dracula eventually begins to confess that he lied about the monster real-estate law, but the rest of the group find them. Things turn sour when Dracula admits his deception regarding passing over the hotel to Mavis and Johnny. This prompts an upset Johnny to believe Dracula does not consider him family and to mutate further before running away.

Mavis goes to find Johnny while Dracula and the rest of the gang go to the Cave of Reflexion. Mavis finds Johnny, but the transformation has turned him very volatile. She leads him to the Cave of Reflexion where they finally find the crystal. When Mavis tries to turn Johnny back to normal, nothing happens due to him being too frenzied. In desperation, Dracula lets himself get captured by Johnny and goes on a remorseful tangent about how wrong he was about Johnny and how he now sees the best in him, finally acknowledging him as family. This brings Johnny back to his senses, and he is returned to human form.

With Dracula and his friends turned back to normal, they return home only to find the hotel has been destroyed by Gigi. After turning Gigi back to normal, Dracula bemoans his loss. He soon decides to let Mavis and Johnny rebuild the hotel to their liking.

One year later, Mavis and Johnny show Dracula the re-built Hotel Transylvania which he comes to enjoy."

Facing financial ruin, he contacts his friend Mike who works with a private military company under the command of fellow veteran Rusty Haynes.

Harper is being headhunted by a number of military contracting companies with lucrative offers but still feels a sense of duty to his country. Mike tells him that Rusty runs clandestine operations for the Department of Defense. Harper agrees to meet Rusty after seeing Mike's opulent house. After the meeting, Harper signs on with Rusty and the team for an operation in Germany. As a sign of good faith, Rusty gives Harper's family $50,000 to help clear their debts.

Harper spends most of his tour surveilling a Middle Eastern scientist named Salim. After analyzing the data, Rusty informs the team that Salim is working for Al-Qaeda and developing a bio-agent. He tells the team they have been given permission to invade Salim's laboratory and retrieve all of his scientific data and then dispose of Salim. The team easily accesses the lab and acquires the data. Mike orders Harper to finish Salim, who protests that he is just a scientist working on a cure. Harper follows orders and then departs after setting the lab on fire. As the three man team return to their exfil van, they encounter the police and after a prolonged shoot-out, during which the remaining team members are killed, Harper rescues a wounded Mike and they hide in a nearby sewage drain.

Mike, believing he is about to die, begs Harper to look after his family and get the data to Rusty. Harper provides a blood transfusion and saves Mike's life. After recuperating, Mike is ready to return to Rusty and the main team, but Harper's knee has given out on him, and he needs to rest up. Mike proceeds alone but informs Harper he will be picked up after he is sufficiently rested.

Harper manages to make it to the agreed hotel and finds fresh clothes but no sign of Mike or Rusty. He tries to treat his injured knee and then gets a burner phone and makes contact with Rusty. Rusty informs him there is a car waiting to exfiltrate him to safety, but Harper senses all is not as it seems. As he delays going to the car, a hit team emerges and they shoot at Harper, forcing him to flee. Harper evades capture and manages to kill the hit team who are revealed to be a team of former Recon Marines working for Rusty and who have been sent to kill Harper. Before dying, one of the Marines gives Harper intel on a safe house but advises him that he can never return home.

Harper visits Salim's home, threatening Sylvie, Salim's wife, into providing him with Salim's computer files. Sylvie gives Harper her husband's iPad, and he leaves for the safe house. After Harper meets Virgil, he is tranquilized and awakens in the safe house. Virgil explains that Harper's knee was infected, and that while it has been treated, Harper still cannot return to his family. Harper plays a video on the iPad in which Salim explains that he was indeed working on a successful H5N1 vaccine formula that he intends to provide for free, rather than sell to a pharmaceutical company. While Virgil shares dinner with Harper, another fire team from Rusty attacks. Virgil is killed, but Harper escapes, setting off a booby trap for Rusty's team.

Harper returns to the US. He tracks down Mike, who explains that Rusty also lied to him and told him Harper had died. Rusty has provided for Harper's family, and Mike advises Harper to disappear; Harper protests. Winning his old friend over, they set-up a plan to get revenge on Rusty.

Mike gets Harper into Rusty's compound, where they surprise Rusty's guards. While Mike directly engages the guard force with an unsuppressed pistol, Harper closes on Rusty's house with a suppressed rifle, taking advantage of his partner's distracting, suppressing fire. Harper manages to terminate Rusty but not before Rusty is able to mortally wound Mike. After destroying the evidence, Harper is finally safe to return to his family."

One day, Sarah awakens to find a pool of blood in her bed and later learns she is terminally ill, and is told that she will die with certainty. The doctor admits to a 2% margin of error, but insists that Sarah's death is certain. To save those she cares about from the pain of losing her, Sarah opts for a cloning procedure of herself to take her place. She soon dubs the clone ""Sarah's Double"" and gives her the basic knowledge of her interests and lifestyle. Ten months later, Sarah is informed that she has, inexplicably, gone into full remission, and that she is going to live. When she arrives at her mother's house to share the good news, she finds Peter and Sarah's Double there and is furious to discover that Sarah's Double had been in contact with her mother for quite some time, against her wishes. The truth now exposed, Sarah tries to return things to normal and demands her clone to be ""decommissioned"", only to be rejected by Peter, as well as her mother, both of whom prefer the clone.

Sarah is told that Sarah's Double requested to stay alive, meaning that, by law, they would have to participate in a publicized duel to the death they must prepare for in a year. Having to pay for her clone as well as herself, Sarah soon takes up self-defense and combat classes with the trainer, Trent. For the next year, Sarah improves herself both physically and mentally, learning to tolerate violence, and how clone duels operate. In lieu of payment for the final month of training, she teaches Trent hip-hop dancing. Feeling confident, Sarah meets up with Peter to state that she means no ill will but promises to unapologetically kill her clone.

While in the middle of a test with Trent, Sarah spots her clone watching from outside and chases her to a nearby playground. There, they talk over their situation before Sarah's Double takes Sarah to a support group for people who survived their duels. Outside, the two bond and agree to escape past the border to live their lives. The next morning, the two hike through a forest where Sarah discovers that Sarah's Double has poisoned her water. Sarah's Double eventually shows up late to the duel alone, lying that she is the original and stating that the ""clone"" has fled. After an investigation and a court hearing, a judge declares her to be the original, freeing her to take over as the only Sarah. However, Sarah's Double is soon left feeling just as depressed and unfulfilled as the original Sarah, carrying her burdens such as the unfiltered Peter and her doting mother (who both know she is the clone). While out driving, Sarah's Double stops in the middle of a roundabout and cries."

He is assigned to kill a man in El Paso, Texas, named Ellis Van Camp (a builder for the Texas Central Processing Facility). Alex's brother turns out to be a resident at a nursing home in El Paso due to his severe Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, Special Agent Vincent Serra (of the FBI's Child Exploitation Task Force) goes undercover to bring down an El Paso sex trafficker ""Papa Leon,"" who trafficked his daughter, Beatriz, 13. Vincent ends up killing Papa Leon after the latter takes Beatriz hostage.

Beatriz is later taken to the facility due to being undocumented but Child Protective Services takes her after she is granted a protection visa. Meanwhile, Alex kills Ellis and steals flash drives from his safe containing footage of Davana's son, Randy, sexually assaulting Beatriz, something that shocks him. Alex is later assigned to kill Beatriz but refuses due to children being off limits to him and tracks down Davana's lawyer William Borden, whom he threatens. Instead, Beatriz is killed by another hitman, Mauricio, which infuriates Alex and makes him seek revenge on Davana.

After Alex sleeps with a woman he meets at a bar after helping her when a drunk man comes on to her, the woman is shot dead by Mauricio, who also attempts to kill Alex. Alex and Mauricio then get into a shootout that ends with Alex gaining the upper hand. He eventually burns the bodies of both Mauricio and the woman after placing them inside Mauricio's car. Later, Alex also shoots William dead, which ultimately causes Davana's son, Randy, to panic after realizing that whoever killed Ellis and William will likely come for him. Meanwhile, Vincent begins piecing together information and he, along with Det. Marquez and Special Agent Linda, uncover that William was the lawyer for Randy Sealman (who owns the facility) and that Ellis was the builder for the facility, who was shot with the same exact slug. The three realize that anyone with connections to the facility ends up dead and that Randy is likely next.

After Randy hosts a party on a yacht, the FBI arrive to make sure he doesn't die. Alex manages to kill Randy after hiding out on the yacht before the party begins. After he makes a run for it, he is cornered by Vincent and Marquez but escapes despite Marquez inflicting a gunshot wound on him. Alex later recuperates inside his hideout (a former bakery once owned by his late father surrounded by pigeons) and stops the bleeding. Alex's Alzheimer symptoms eventually begin worsening, but he makes his way to Davana's penthouse to kill her. He instead shoots several police officers before being knocked out by Det. Danny Mora. Meanwhile, Davana hires another man to kill Alex as retribution for the death of Randy.

After Alex is hospitalized, Vincent and Linda retrieve the flash drives from his hideout. They see Alex in the hospital, and his ability to speak is hindered, but he informs Vincent that he has evidence of Davana threatening Ellis, which should be enough to put her on trial, but says he cannot remember where he placed the recording. After the assassin hired to kill Alex comes for him, Alex instead takes him hostage. Snipers later surround the hospital as Alex walks out holding the man hired to kill him as a hostage, the snipers mistakenly kill the hostage. Alex gets inside Vincent's car and says Davana wishes to ""bery"" him before stepping out and being shot dead. After Vincent later realizes that Alex gave him a clue with the word ""bery,"" he retrieves the recording of Davana threatening Ellis but is instead told by the district attorney that it is not enough to prosecute. Instead, Marquez kills Davana by slitting her throat (while masked), and Vincent and Linda watch the news report at a bar. Vincent realizes that Linda took him to the bar to give him an alibi."
31,Three Thousand Years of Longing,https://youtu.be/TWGvntl9itE,https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWGvntl9itE,"Aug 31, 2022",,"Dr Alithea Binnie, played by Tilda Swinton with a northern accent and school-marmish glasses, specialises in ""narratology"", which sounds like an academic field made up for The Da Vinci Code, but is actually the study of narrative structure. She is at a conference in Istanbul when she buys a stripy glass bottle from a shop in the Grand Bazaar, and then polishes it with her electric toothbrush in her hotel room. Before she can say ""Aladdin"", a djinn appears, as played by Idris Elba with pointed ears and furry legs – and once you see Elba towering over Swinton, with his rumbling voice and his sweet mixture of authority and self-doubt, you can't picture anyone else in the role.

He offers to grant her the traditional three wishes, but Alithea – who is oddly unfazed by this turn of events – has read enough books to know that djinns can be tricky and that wishes can be dangerous, so she won't commit herself until they have sat in their white fluffy dressing gowns and got to know each other. As she listens, he recalls the previous times he was released from his bottle, and the film flashes back to various yarns about foolish sultans, angry princes and wily concubines through the centuries. The djinn, it transpires, repeatedly gets into trouble by trying to help women. Will Alithea be one of them?

Three Thousand Years of Longing is bound to gain a cult following among literature students, fairy-tale buffs, and anyone who sees themselves as being as geeky and emotionally cut-off as its determinedly single heroine. (As the title suggests, one of the film's main themes is the desire to love and be loved.) For everyone else, it's reassuring that such an eccentric and personal passion project exists – and with a largely non-English-speaking cast, to boot. You can file it alongside the Wachowskis' adaptation of Cloud Atlas, or one of Terry Gilliam's later works, as pleasing evidence that an auteur can still sometimes make an extravagant exotic fantasy with an indie sensibility.

32,Deep Water,https://youtu.be/h0zqe_As_qo,https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0zqe_As_qo,"Mar 18, 2022",,"Vic and Melinda Van Allen are a couple with a daughter, Trixie, living in the small town of Little Wesley, Louisiana. Vic is a retired robotics engineer, having amassed a great fortune developing the guidance chips used in combat drones. Their loveless marriage is held together only by a precarious arrangement whereby, in order to avoid the messiness of divorce, Melinda is allowed to take any number of lovers as long as she does not desert her family. Even then, their open marriage is made no secret amongst their friends, while Vic silently grows increasingly jealous of Melinda's lovers.

Melinda invites one of her lovers, musician Joel Dash, to a party. While alone with Joel, Vic tells him that he murdered her previous boyfriend, Martin McRae, who had disappeared a month earlier. The story floats around their social group, causing Joel to move away and raising the suspicions of Don Wilson, a writer who, along with his wife and daughter, is new to the town. It is later revealed on the TV news that Martin was found shot to death, thus proving that Vic did not actually kill him.

Melinda's next lover, piano teacher Charlie De Lisle, is invited to a pool party at the home of Vic's friend Jonas Fernandez; Melinda continuously flirts with and flaunts Charlie in front of all the party guests, making Vic increasingly jealous. While they play around in the pool, it begins raining and everyone rushes inside, leaving Vic and Charlie alone in the water. Melinda later discovers, to her horror, Charlie dead in the pool, apparently from drowning. Upon questioning by police, Melinda is quick to accuse Vic of murdering Charlie, further raising Don’s suspicions. With help from Melinda, Don secretly hires a private investigator, who later poses as a psychotherapist. Vic, however, is quick to uncover this plot and crashes a Wilson family lunch, accusing Don of his wrongdoings.

Sometime later, Melinda reunites with an old college boyfriend, Tony Cameron, whose flirtatious behaviour incites jealousy within Vic. Vic drives Tony into the woods alone, before pushing him off a rocky hill, killing him. Vic then sinks the body into a nearby creek. Some time later, Vic returns to the creek to retrieve Melinda's scarf from a picnic trip they had the previous day, but as he attempts to sink Tony's body further into the water, he is suddenly surprised by Don, who catches him in the act and then recklessly drives his car to flee for help with Vic in pursuit, but in the ensuing chaos Don accidentally swerves his car off a cliff and is killed instantly upon impact.

At the same time, Melinda finds Tony's wallet with his identification in one of Vic's snail tanks, confirming Vic's knowledge of Tony's whereabouts. Melinda begins packing, intending to leave with their daughter, only to be defiantly confronted by Trixie to stay. After contemplating, Melinda burns Tony's ID, suggesting she intends to stay with Vic as he returns home."

Clarke double-crosses and kills him just as the authorities raid the mansion. Amid the chaos, Colombian DNI agent Luis Rojas obtains the device. CIA operative Mason ""Mace"" Brown is assigned to purchase the drive from Rojas. She heads to Paris with longtime partner Nick Fowler, who is in love with her. The deal goes south when German undercover BND agent Marie Schmidt swipes the bag holding the money. Mace chases Marie, who escapes via the subway while Nick is confronted in an alley by Clarke.

At CIA headquarters, Mace learns that Nick was found dead in the alley. Her superior, Larry Marks, gives her his blessing to retrieve the drive by any means. Mace travels to London to recruit a longtime friend, retired British MI6 operative Khadijah Adiyeme. Rojas arranges to hand the drive over to Graciela Rivera, a DNI psychologist with no field experience. Marie is pushed to go after the drive by her boss, Jonas Muller, who brings up how Marie's father was a senior BND agent whom she personally turned after discovering that he was a Russian mole.

Mace and Khadijah track Luis and Graciela to a market only for the DNI agent overseeing the handoff to turn on them and kill Luis; before dying, he gives Graciela a phone only she can open that tracks the drive. Both Mace and Marie chase the thief, who escapes. Marie takes Graciela to a safe house with Mace and Khadijah arriving. Khadijah points out they all want the drive and are better off working together. The four track the thief to Morocco, apprehending him and taking out rival mercenaries before handing the drive over to Marks. While celebrating over drinks, news breaks of planes crashing, and cities hit by massive power outages—indicating the drive is in terrorists' hands. They return to the safe house to find Marks dead. After escaping from a CIA assault squad, the women realize they have been framed for Marks' death and the theft of the device.

Under interrogation, the thief reveals that the recent incidents are all part of a ""demonstration"" for prospective buyers at an illegal black-market auction in Shanghai. The group infiltrates the auction where Mace is shocked to discover that not only is Nick alive, but is secretly Clarke's mole in the CIA. The group fails to prevent him from obtaining the device, but a mysterious Chinese woman helps them escape the auction. She identifies herself as Lin Mi Sheng, and explains that the drive was used as bait to allow her agency to identify the criminals in attendance. She also tells Mace that Marks had been on Clarke's payroll, and that she took the device from Nick during their escape.

Nick is beaten by Clarke's men for bringing a decoy device. He then captures the group, revealing that Clarke has Muller, Khadijah's boyfriend Ahmed, and Graciela's family as hostages. Nick executes Lin's elderly father in front of the group, while Muller and Ahmed are executed on camera. Lin agrees to travel with Clarke and hand over the drive personally to spare Graciela's family. The other women overcome their grief to realize Lin is transmitting her location through a camera in her glasses. Arming themselves, they rescue Lin, shoot Nick, and destroy the drive before getting arrested.

Two months later, Nick, now promoted to a senior rank in the CIA for killing Clarke, returns home to find Mace and the group waiting for him after escaping from custody. Nick passes out from a drug in his drink, and is told he will pay for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in a foreign prison. The women go their separate ways but suspect they will somehow reunite to fight the corruption of their various agencies."
34,Stars at Noon,https://youtu.be/MBZLsNZ7y3Y,https://www.youtube.com/embed/MBZLsNZ7y3Y,"May 25, 2022",,"A young American journalist stranded in present-day Nicaragua falls for an enigmatic Englishman who seems like her best chance of escape. She soon realizes, though, that he may be in even greater danger than she is.[1] The film, unlike the novel, which is set during the Nicaraguan Revolution, is set in the pandemic-era present day.

One night in the Inter-Continental Hotel bar, she spots Alwyn's character, Daniel, a brooding loner who claims to be working for an oil company, but keeps a gun stashed in his hotel bathroom. He wears a white suit which is obviously going to get a lot more stained and crumpled as the film goes on. Both Qualley and Alwyn are a little too fresh-faced and youthful to be the jaded, well-travelled lost souls they're supposed to be, but Qualley throws herself into the role with firecracker energy, and the gravel-voiced, chain-smoking Alwyn does a serviceable audition to be the next James Bond.
The day after they've spent the night together in his hotel room, she spots him again, this time having a breakfast meeting with a businessman (Danny Ramirez). Or is he? Trish works out that the other man is a Costa-Rican policeman, and that he's planning to arrest Daniel at the very least. The lovers have to get out of the country as quickly and quietly as possible, and so they immediately spring into action. Well, no, not really. What they actually do is go back to her motel room for lots of sweaty sex, popping out on occasion to knock back industrial quantities of booze. Take the title of Denis' much-loved 2008 drama, 35 Shots of Rum, add an equivalent amount of beer, and you'll have some idea of how much alcohol they get through.

The characters' willingness to indulge in rest and recuperation – or, perhaps, their desperate, fatalistic need to do so – is typical of a film that has the nail-biting plot of a politically-charged conspiracy thriller, but which is much more concerned with atmosphere than activity. There are scenes in which the fugitives have to hotwire cars and wrongfoot their pursuers. There are shootings, assassinations and an over-friendly US ""consultant"" (Benny Safdie) who clearly works for the CIA. But over the course of two-and-a-quarter hours, Denis's beguiling, immersive film drifts here and there, as if its strength has been sapped by the steamy tropical heat.
There is plenty of time to admire the ominous city streets and the lush countryside, and to appreciate the cool, jazzy score by the Tindersticks. There is also plenty of time to try and work out what on Earth is going on. The characters keep making gnomic, ironic comments, but it's almost impossible to tell what they mean or who they are. They hardly ever explain what's happening, and when they do explain it, you're left more confused than you were when they started.

Maybe the film won't be a crossover hit, then. Partly because the characters look so healthily pretty, and partly because the mood is so woozy, The Stars at Noon feels more like a stylish pastiche of a Graham Greene novel than the story of real people battling their way out of a difficult, potentially deadly situation. It's beautifully made, but to enjoy it you have to relax, and let it wash over you. Just be careful not to treat it as part of a drinking game. Anyone who attempts to match the protagonists' alcohol intake will be hospitalised before the halfway mark…"
35,Moonfall,https://youtu.be/ivIwdQBlS10,https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivIwdQBlS10,"Feb 4, 2022",,"In 2011, astronauts Brian Harper, Jocinda Fowler, and newcomer Marcus are on a Space Shuttle mission to repair a satellite. Suddenly, a mysterious Black Swarm attacks the orbiter, killing Marcus and incapacitating Fowler before Harper can re-enter the shuttle. Although he is initially hailed as a hero for successfully returning the crippled shuttle to Earth, Harper tries to tell his story, which is dismissed by NASA. After an eighteen-month-long investigation, human error is blamed for the incident, and Harper's account remains widely disbelieved. When Fowler fails to defend him during the hearing, Harper is fired from NASA.

Ten years later, conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman, who believes the Moon is an artificial megastructure, secretly uses time on a research telescope and discovers that the orbit of the Moon is now veering closer to Earth. He attempts to share his findings with NASA but is unsuccessful in his efforts. He then turns to Harper, who dismisses him, leading Houseman to go public on social media with his discovery. NASA independently discovers the anomaly and mounts a Moon mission using an SLS Block 2 spacecraft to investigate the abnormality. The same alien Swarm that attacked Harper's shuttle a decade earlier reappears, killing all three lunar astronauts after they drop a probe into a kilometers-deep artificial shaft that has opened up on the Moon's surface.

As the lunar orbit continues to deteriorate, the Moon falls closer and closer to Earth, causing cataclysmic disasters such as tsunamis, gravitational abnormalities, and atmospheric dissipation. Fowler, now the deputy director of NASA, learns that Apollo 11 had discovered lunar surface abnormalities during its historic landing and that a two-minute radio blackout was meant to conceal how the Moon resonated strongly when the spacecraft's fuel tanks were jettisoned, hitting the lunar surface, suggesting that it had a hollow interior. A military program code-named ZX7 had created an EMP device in an attempt to kill the Swarm but was abandoned for budgetary reasons. Fowler orders the EMP device brought out of storage and brings the retired Space Shuttle Endeavour out of its museum to serve the new mission. Harper, Houseman, and Fowler launch with the EMP, narrowly escaping to orbit as a gigantic tsunami wave destroys Vandenberg Space Force Base.

As the crew enters the interior of the Moon, they discover that the Swarm is siphoning off energy generated by a white dwarf located at the center of the Moon, causing the artificial megastructure's orbit to destabilize as its power source is depleted. Harper learns that the megastructure was constructed by the ancient ancestors of humanity, who were more technologically advanced than their present-day descendants. The Moon was constructed billions of years in the past as a space ark to repopulate humanity, which was being hunted by a rogue artificial intelligence that grew too strong. The Swarm on the Moon is one of those malicious AIs, which responds to electronic activity in the presence of any organic life. As the Moon continues to approach the Earth, the President of the United States gives the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Jenkins, orders to launch a nuclear strike at the Moon. However, the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Doug Davidson, refuses to carry out the strike order, so he can save the lives of his ex-wife (Fowler), as well as both Harper and Houseman while sacrificing his own life in the process.

Meanwhile, Harper's son, Sonny, escorts Fowler's son, Jimmy, and their nanny, Michelle, in an attempt to reach Davidson's military bunker in the Colorado mountains. They reach Aspen and reunite with Harper's ex-wife and Sonny's mom, Brenda, as well as his step-family. But they are caught in the multiple disasters caused by the rapid destruction wrought by the near proximity of the Moon. As the group makes their way towards the bunker, they fight off other survivors and increasingly deadly natural disasters before reaching the safety of a deep mountain tunnel. Brenda's husband, Tom, sacrifices himself to save his youngest daughter, suffocating as the Moon strips away the localized atmosphere by its gravitational pull during a close by orbital pass.

Houseman uses the EMP device and their lunar module to lure the Swarm away from their spacecraft before detonating the device. His sacrifice obliterates the Swarm and allows Fowler and Harper to escape to the now nearby Earth. With its power and systems restored, the Moon structure begins to return to its regular orbit. Fowler and Harper successfully land their spacecraft in Colorado and are eventually reunited with Sonny, Jimmy, Michelle, and Brenda.

The Moon's operating system, itself an AI being created by humanity's ancient ancestors, reveals that it stored a copy of Houseman's consciousness as he sacrificed himself. Appearing to the reconstructed Houseman as his mother and cat, Fuzz Aldrin, the AI projection remarks that they now need to get to work on repairing the massive destruction wrought upon the Earth."

Their adoptive father and hospital director Nicholas arranges for Morbius to attend medical school in New York while he focuses on caring for Milo.

25 years later, Morbius publicly declines a Nobel Prize for his work with artificial blood. His colleague Martine Bancroft discovers he has secretly captured dozens of vampire bats from Costa Rica in the hope of splicing their genes with his own to cure his condition. After informing Milo of his planned illegal experiment, Morbius receives funding from him to outfit a private mercenary vessel in international waters with his equipment. While the cure works, it transforms Morbius into a vampire, who kills and drains the crew of their blood after they attack him out of fear. Once his bloodlust subsides and he regains his senses, a horrified Morbius erases all CCTV footage of his experiment before contacting the authorities and jumping overboard.

Morbius returns to New York and discovers he now has superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and echolocation, with his vampire bats treating him as a bat. To control his bloodlust, he subsists on his artificial blood as it gradually ceases to satisfy his needs. FBI agents Simon Stroud and Al Rodriguez investigate Morbius' victims and deduce his involvement. Milo learns that Morbius is cured, but becomes furious when Morbius refuses to cure him as well. While checking on a hospitalized Bancroft, Morbius finds a dead nurse, drained of her blood. Believing he was responsible, he attempts to escape before being cornered and arrested. In prison, he is visited by Milo, who offers to use his wealth to free him. Upon realizing Milo took his cure and killed the nurse, Morbius escapes to confront him. An unrepentant Milo confesses to his bloodlust-induced crime and urges Morbius to embrace his powers as he has. Unwilling to hurt his brother, Morbius flees.

Morbius meets Bancroft to explain what Milo has done before acquiring a new lab and developing an antibody against vampirism to stop and kill Milo; he also plans to use it on himself since he will become unable to resist his bloodlust. Stroud and Rodriguez find footage of one of Milo's attacks and, believing Morbius' vampirism to be spreading, release it to the media. Nicholas recognizes Milo and pleads with him to stop. Angered by Nicholas' perceived preference for Morbius, Milo wounds and forces him to call Morbius, who arrives too late to save him while Milo also mortally wounds Bancroft. Morbius returns to Bancroft, but she dies in his arms, forcing him to drink her blood. Morbius confronts Milo and summons an army of bats to restrain him and inject the antibody. Milo dies peacefully and Morbius flies off with the bats, mourning his loved ones and embracing his identity as a vampire while coming to terms with the fact he is now on the run from the authorities. Unbeknownst to him, a still-alive Bancroft reawakens with glowing red eyes elsewhere, having ingested a drop of Morbius' blood whilst he was feeding on her.

In two mid-credits scenes, Adrian Toomes finds himself transported to Morbius' universe.[a] Having deduced that his transportation involved Spider-Man, Toomes approaches the fugitive Morbius and suggests that they form a team.[b]"

While inspecting a dilapidated orphanage, the group discover it is still occupied by an elderly woman called Ginny. When she claims she has papers to prove she still owns the property, an argument breaks out, briefly interrupted by a silent and towering man from upstairs.

Ginny then collapses from a heart attack and is rushed to the hospital, accompanied by Ruth and the man. An investor, Catherine, along with a group of potential buyers arrive in Harlow on a large bus, distracting Melody and Dante. Meanwhile, Lila strikes up a friendship with a local mechanic, Richter, and reveals she was a survivor of a school shooting, leaving her terrified of guns. Ginny dies en route to the hospital; Ruth texts Melody before the man goes berserk and murders the officers driving the ambulance, leading it to crash.

When Ruth awakes, she witnesses the man, revealed to be Leatherface, cutting off Ginny's face to wear as a mask. Ruth manages to radio for help before being killed by Leatherface, who makes his way back to Harlow. During a property auction, Melody reads Ruth's texts and prepares to leave with Lila. Richter overhears them talking about Ginny's death and takes their keys, agreeing to give them back once they provide proof they rightfully removed Ginny from her home. Melody and Dante return to the orphanage to find them.

Sally Hardesty, the sole survivor of Leatherface's previous killing spree and now a battle-hardened Texas Ranger, learns of Ruth's attack and heads out to investigate. At the orphanage, Melody discovers the papers and realizes that Ginny was wrongfully evicted. Leatherface arrives at the orphanage and attacks Dante, mutilating him. Melody hides as Leatherface retrieves his chainsaw from his bedroom. A thunderstorm hits Harlow as night falls, and Catherine and Lila take cover in the bus with the buyers. Dante manages to stumble out of the orphanage where he is discovered by Richter before bleeding to death. Richter enters the orphanage and is attacked and killed by Leatherface. Melody retrieves the car and bus keys from his body before fleeing the house, reuniting with Lila. They get on the bus, pursued by Leatherface who slaughters all of the people aboard, including Catherine.

Melody and Lila escape the carnage and come across Sally who locks them in her car before entering the orphanage to finally confront Leatherface. She holds him at gunpoint, demanding he remembers the pain he inflicted on her and her friends, but is met by only silence before Leatherface walks away. Leatherface then attacks the sisters in Sally's car but they are saved by Sally who shoots him. Sally gives Melody the keys to drive away before pursuing Leatherface. Leatherface ambushes and fatally injures Sally. Melody hits Leatherface with Sally's car before crashing into a nearby building; Melody is trapped but orders Lila to run away. When Leatherface appears, Melody apologises for what they did to Ginny. As he moves in to attack, Lila attempts to shoot him, but her gun is empty. Sally shoots him instead and he flees. Before dying, she encourages Lila not to run as she will be forever haunted by him as she was.

Lila then takes Sally's shotgun and pursues Leatherface into an abandoned building where she is ambushed and attacked. Melody arrives and takes Leatherface's chainsaw before using it to uppercut him, knocking him into a pool of water where he sinks to the bottom. They escape and Lila finds Sally's hat and puts it on before starting the morning drive back home.

However, Leatherface emerges, still alive, and drags Melody out of the car before decapitating her with his chainsaw. A horrified Lila watches as the self-driving car takes her out of Harlow. Leatherface dances in the street with his chainsaw and Melody's head.

In a post-credits scene, Leatherface makes his way to the house where his original massacre took place in 1973."

That evening, she is killed in a deliberately planned hit-and-run outside of her home by her opposers.

Travis Block, a Vietnam War veteran, works off-the-books directly for FBI Director Gabriel Robinson as a fixer, extracting undercover agents who are in unstable or tricky situations and other complex jobs Robinson assigns him to do. He wants to retire and spend more time with his daughter and granddaughter, but Robinson is reluctant to let him go. Block's current assignment is to bring in undercover FBI Agent Dusty Crane.

However, Crane goes rogue and contacts a journalist, Mira Jones, claiming to have information about Flores' death. Block finds Crane and they engage in a chase outside of Jones' office. Crane escapes and arranges a new meeting with Jones at a museum. Block follows Jones to the meeting and attempts to apprehend Crane. Crane escapes his custody again, but briefly tells Block that Flores was killed by order of Robinson right before he is shot dead by two FBI Agents.

Block and Jones meet, and she tells him that Crane claimed to have information about Operation Unity, a top secret FBI program run by Robinson that kills innocent civilians, including Flores. Block confronts Robinson about Operation Unity, but Robinson claims his innocence, and warns Block not to get in his way.

Jones's editor, Drew, writes a story from her sources about Crane's mysterious death. That evening, he is followed home by a black SUV and is killed after a car accident by the same two FBI Agents that killed Crane and Flores. Meanwhile, Block's family goes missing.

Jones convinces a distressed Block to help her uncover the mystery of Operation Unity and the deaths of Crane and Drew. He tells her that Robinson has a safe in his house with government secrets. He confronts Robinson at his house and forces him to open the safe, which contains a hard drive with information about Operation Unity on it. Robinson escapes, with the help of several FBI Agents, who engage in a gunfight with Block. After defeating the agents, Block retrieves the hard drive.

Block and Jones review the data on the hard drive and discover that Crane was in love with his assignment, Flores. Robinson had her killed after Crane got too attached to her. Block confronts Robinson with the truth about Operation Unity and forces him to turn himself in to the authorities. Robinson is arrested for his crimes, Jones completes her story about the government cover-up and Block retires from his job as a off-the-books fixer and reunites with his family who had been placed in Witness Protection, but are now brought back home."
39,Lightyear,https://youtu.be/wHBBoUtJHhA,https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHBBoUtJHhA,"Jun 17, 2022",,"Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger in Star Command, and his commanding officer and best friend, Alisha Hawthorne, explore the habitable planet, T'Kani Prime, with their new recruit, Featheringhamstan. They are forced to retreat to their exploration vessel after discovering that the planet hosts hostile lifeforms. Buzz damages the vessel during the retreat, forcing the crew to evacuate in order to conduct repairs and continue their journey.

One year later, the crew have constructed a nascent colony along with the necessary infrastructure to conduct repairs. Buzz volunteers to test hyperspace fuel, a key component of the repairs. However, after a four-minute test, he finds that four years have passed on T'Kani Prime, due to the effects of time dilation from having traveled at relativistic speeds. Buzz is introduced to Sox, a robotic feline, and continues testing the hyperspace fuel. With every test, four more years pass on T'Kani Prime, until eventually over 62 years have passed. During this time, the colony develops; Alisha raises a son with her wife Kiko, their son grows up, gets a promotion and gets married. Alisha subsequently dies of old age; and Sox improves the fuel's composition, allowing it to obtain faster-than-light speeds.

Against the orders of his new commanding officer, Commander Burnside, Buzz uses this new fuel composition for a successful hyperspace test. Upon landing, Buzz discovers 22 years have passed, during which T'Kani Prime has been invaded by Zyclops robots led by the mysterious Zurg. Buzz meets up with members of the colony’s defense forces, including Izzy Hawthorne, Alisha’s now-adult granddaughter; Mo Morrison, a fresh, naïve recruit; and Darby Steel, an elderly paroled convict. While initially reluctant to work with them, Buzz eventually warms to them. Together, they plan to attack Zurg’s ship and destroy the invading force.

Following an encounter, Zurg abducts Buzz, bringing him aboard his ship where he reveals that he is an older version of him from an alternate timeline in which, after the successful hyperspace test, Burnside attempted to arrest him for stealing the craft and forced him to escape. Aided by the effects of time dilation, he traveled to the far future, encountering a technologically advanced and abandoned vessel. He assumed Zurg's identity by wearing his signature mecha suit, and traveled to the now-present to obtain more hyperspace fuel from Buzz in order to travel further back in time and prevent the exploration vessel from landing on T'Kani Prime in the first place. However, Buzz refuses due to the implications of the possible temporal paradox that would result from such actions, which would wipe out the current timeline and everyone from it. Meanwhile, Izzy, Mo, Darby, and Sox board Zurg’s ship to assist Buzz. After a chaotic assault on the ship, Buzz and his comrades-in-arms destroy the ship and escape.

However, Zurg, having survived his ship's destruction, arrives and attacks Buzz, grabbing the hyperspace fuel. Buzz shoots the fuel, causing it to explode and incapacitate Zurg. With the fuel gone, Buzz wishes to stay on T'Kani Prime. Upon landing, Burnside arrests Buzz, but relents, allowing Buzz to revive the Space Ranger Corps. Buzz selects Izzy, Mo, Darby, and Sox to form the core of this organization, much to Burnside's surprise. Buzz and his team are then sent off to a new adventure in parts unknown. In a post-credits scene, a seemingly lifeless Zurg is floating in space when his eyes suddenly light up.[4]"
40,Firestarter,https://youtu.be/59MJfJPP5eo,https://www.youtube.com/embed/59MJfJPP5eo,"May 12, 2022",,"In a flashback, baby Charlene ""Charlie"" McGee sits in her crib, spontaneously setting the room ablaze with her pyrokinesis power and sending her father Andrew ""Andy"" McGee into a panic. In another flashback, a young Andy and his girlfriend Victoria ""Vicky"" Tomlinson talk to a doctor in a clinical trial, who explains to them that they will be injected with the experimental chemical drug Lot-6, which secretly gives them supernatural powers: Andy gains telepathy, and Vicky obtains telekinesis.

In the present day, Charlie is sitting at the kitchen table after having a nightmare. Her parents join her and Charlie explains that she has been repressing something bad, her powers becoming more unstable. She unintentionally causes a ruckus at her school after exploding a bathroom stall due to anger at being bullied. Andy is shown using his power, ""the push"", to influence a client to stop smoking, although the strain causes his eyes to bleed.

Meanwhile, in a secret facility, Captain Jane Hollister, leader of the DSI, is monitoring thermal signatures caused by Charlie's outbursts. She visits Doctor Joseph Wanless, creator of Lot-6 and the resulting superhumans, who implores Hollister to terminate Charlie before her powers become uncontrollable. Hollister enlists fellow superhuman John Rainbird to assist her. Rainbird visits the McGee home, confronting Vicky who attempts to counterattack with her repressed telekinetic powers. Rainbird overpowers and kills her, holding Charlie at knifepoint as she and Andy enter the home. Charlie's powers overwhelm him and she sends a concussive burst of flames throughout the house. Andy and Charlie escape into their truck.

On the road, they encounter a man named Irv. After using the push to convince Irv to take them to Boston, they hitch a ride with him, stopping off at his house. After Charlie accidentally stumbles upon his paralyzed wife, Irv flies into a rage before conceding that he occasionally overreacts. Irv sits up all night watching a news report of the incident at the McGee home, which is being framed as murder by Andy. Irv and Andy argue before Andy explains to Irv that he is just trying to protect his daughter. Charlie tells Irv, after speaking telepathically with his wife, that she forgives him for the accident that left her paralysed, causing him to relent and attempt to protect Andy and Charlie when the police appear due to his prior emergency call. Rainbird appears in the bushes, kills the policemen, and then shoots Irv in the knee before black trucks roll in to pick up Charlie and Andy. Andy uses his push one last time to trick Rainbird so Charlie can escape to a forest. Charlie spends time honing her fire powers before stealing a bike and clothes to follow her father's telepathic message to her from his cell at DSI.

Charlie finds DSI and takes an agent's pass card from him. He pleads for her not to kill him and tells her he doesn't have a gun. She kills him after he draws the gun to attack her. She follows a large staircase down to the restricted area where her father is being kept. She reaches her father's glass-fronted cell, from inside which Captain Hollister tells her not to try and burn her, lest she burns her father in the process. Andy tells Charlie that Rainbird, not he, telepathically called for her. Seeing no other way out, he apologizes to her and then mentally pushes her to burn the entire place down, starting with Hollister and himself. The now-rogue Charlie sets both on fire, mentally unlocks all the security doors, and walks through the facility killing everyone. Rainbird is released when his holding cell is unlocked. Charlie is captured by men in fire suits, unable to harm them. The men are about to subdue her when Rainbird shoots them from behind. He surrenders to Charlie and kneels for her judgment. Charlie starts to kill him but sees herself in the mirror and, realizing that the DSI is also controlling him, she spares him, before finally burning the rest of the building down. Lastly, Charlie is seen walking onto a beach with Rainbird following behind. Knowing that she and Rainbird are now alone in the world, Charlie allows Rainbird to carry her, and they walk off together into the night."

The gang gets mad at them, causing Crash and Eddie to secretly leave their temporary camp. When Crash and Eddie stumble upon the entrance to the Lost World, a land full of dinosaurs, Ellie insists that the gang search for them. Crash and Eddie run into Buck Wild, who saves them from raptors and tells them that a Protoceratops named Orson, who was bullied when he was young for having a massive brain, has escaped from exile and has come to conquer the Lost World. Buck tries to get Crash and Eddie back to their home, but find that Orson has covered the entrance with a boulder.

Buck and the possums go to Buck's shelter, where Buck explains how he used to be part of an old team that established the watering hole as a place for animals to peacefully co-exist. He goes on to say that Orson did not accept an offer to join his team because he believed in a world where the strong dominate the weak with him being the leader of them all. Buck further explains that they defeated Orson and banished him to an island, where he learned that he can control two raptors with fire.

The two raptors find Buck's hideout, but Zee, a zorilla who used to be part of Buck's former team, saves Buck and the possums by using a gas to knock out the raptors. Orson then gets an army of raptors and attacks the watering hole, with Buck and Zee telling the animals to evacuate. Buck and Zee, their relationship strained after their team's breakup, go with the possums to get help. They arrive at the Lost Lagoon and summon their old friend Momma, a Tyrannosaurus. When Orson and his raptors arrive and attack them again, Buck and Zee forgive each other for breaking up the old team and agree to work together. Acting as a diversion, Buck is captured by Orson, allowing the others to escape.

Trying to figure out how Orson controls the raptors, Zee and the possums devise a plan to get Buck back. Ellie and the others figure out that Crash and Eddie entered the Lost World and uncover the entrance. They run into Momma, who tells them Crash and Eddie are in danger. Zee and the possums free Buck and with the help of the others, fight Orson and his army. Buck tries to explain to Orson that everyone needs to live in peace, but Orson arrogantly rebuffs him and continues to fight. After figuring out that Orson controls the raptors with fire, Crash and Eddie create a fire of their own and stop the raptors from fighting and make them chase Orson instead, saving the Lost World.

Ellie and the others apologize to Crash and Eddie and ask them to come home, but Crash and Eddie express that they want to stay in the Lost World with Buck and Zee. Saddened by their decision, Ellie allows them to stay and says goodbye, but Crash and Eddie still come to visit the gang often."
42,Big Gold Brick,https://youtu.be/EIG4J1FuIIk,https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIG4J1FuIIk,"Feb 25, 2022",,"Watching this bloated, meretricious, unfunny, strained, and ultimately trite black comedy/fantasy, one may remember the phrase that the 1960s suburban mother and housewife who lives in all of our heads would use after being exposed to a psychedelic rock tune: “Well, that was different.” Except, well, it really isn’t.

“Big Gold Brick” opens with the image of Sam Lifton, its ostensible protagonist, in his schlubbiest incarnation. He’s floating in space, the result, we later learn, of being struck by a car. In voiceover Sam says, “I never believed in fate, destiny, kismet, whatever you want to call it.” Indeed. How does he get hit by a car? He leaves his apartment and catches a bus out of town, to the accompaniment of the King Crimson song “Red.” After leaving the bus he wanders the streets, and Andy Garcia’s Floyd, eating ice cream in his Cadillac, plows right into him.

We know things are going to work out okay, sort of, for Sam, because the movie is flecked with scenes in which he is less schlubby, has better hair (for most of the movie it is long, helmet-like where it’s not stringy) and is recording an audiobook or giving a reading or talking incredulously to a publisher. His account of his acquaintance with Floyd, entitled “Big Bricks of Gold,” is destined, so to speak, to become a literary event.

But for most of the movie Sam, played by Emory Cohen, comes off like a combination of a tormented H.P. Lovecraft protagonist (he’s super ticcy), a young Sam Kinison, and “Bighead” on “Silicon Valley.” He’s supposedly a writer, but there’s not much lit talk here, which is maybe a blessing. Because the level of pretension in this movie, written and directed by Brian Petsos, is high enough without it.

Floyd is mortified over having hit and grievously wounded Sam. In the hospital, he offers Sam a deal: free room and board at his roomy suburban semi-manse, and $500 cash a week, in exchange for Sam writing Floyd’s biography.

Floyd’s family is a motley one. Because of course it is. His second wife Jacqueline, “a successful attorney” in Sam’s description, is played by a not-up-to-much Megan Fox. Tween son Edward (Leonidas Castrounis) is a death metal fan perhaps into vivisection. Teen daughter Lily (Lucy Hale) is a former musical prodigy who stepped down from the ladder of success by finishing a recital by smashing her violin and smearing her lipstick like David Bowie in the “Boys Keep Swinging” video. Of course, at one point Jacqueline attempts to seduce Sam. Of course, not because it’s even vaguely plausible, but because this is just the kind of self-anointed-male-genius opus in which this sort of thing has to happen. (It’s possible, one supposes, that the seduction scene, and the idea that Lucy also finds something attractive in him, are Sam’s delusions. But I challenge you to care enough to make a decision on this.) When he’s not being improbably semi-seduced, or listening to tall tales from Floyd, Sam is tormented by vivid nightmares and indeed day-mares, like a talking Santa doll in the in which bedroom Floyd has installed him.

As it happens, if you’re interested in some kind of auteurist personal thread, there’s a talking stuffed monkey in “Lightningface,” the 2016 short film that Petsos directed, one of two boorish shorts (the other is 2014’s “Ticky Tacky”) on which Petsos and actor Oscar Isaac collaborated. Isaac appears here as well, as a mysterious malefactor who takes hits from an inhaler and talks in a sort of Strangelove speak and shoots a guy he says is his cousin, after which he says to Sam and Floyd “If I would do that to him ... my cousin,” which is a bit of a riff on Mark Rydell’s bit in Robert Altman’s “The Long Goodbye.” 

Like many of us, Petsos has seen a lot of movies. But unlike many other film enthusiasts turned filmmakers, he hasn’t figured out anything useful to do with his influences. There are threads in this movie that suggest Richard Kelly, Wes Anderson, David Lynch, the Coen brothers, and more. And the music cues here, and in Petsos’ shorts, are very nudgy. (Apropos Crimson’s “Red,” Petsos actually edits it, poorly, for length in the first sequence it’s used. This was a bad call when Scorsese made it with Mott The Hoople’s “All The Way From Memphis” in “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” and it’s a bad call here.) And there’s not much else. Feature-length failures as abject as this one are almost frightening, in part because one worries about what kind of a snit the director will be working out if/when he gets a second shot."
